<h1>IN WILD-ROSE TIME</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_1'></a>1</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>I—A HANDFUL OF ROSES</h2>
<p>
“Hev a bunch o’ roses, mem? Fresh wild
roses with the dew on ’em. Jes’ picked. On’y
ten cents.”
</p>
<p>
They dropped in at the open window, and landed
on Virginia Deering’s lap. Her first impulse was
to throw them out again, as she half said to herself,
“I hate wild roses, I always shall!” But
she glanced down into such a forlorn, wistful face,
that her heart was touched, a not unkindly heart,
though it had been bitter and obdurate with the
unreason of youth.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, please buy ’em, mem. Mammy’s sick and
can’t do nothin’, an’ Ben’s got a fever. On’y ten
cents.”
</p>
<p>
The poor child, in her ragged dress, was clean
enough. Her face had a starved, eager look, and
the earnest pleading in the eyes bespoke necessity
seldom counterfeited. Miss Deering opened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2'></a>2</span>
her pretty silver-clasped purse and handed out a
quarter.
</p>
<p>
“All of it?” hesitatingly. “Oh, thanky, thanky!
We’d sold the chickens, and everything we could,
and Ben said city folks was fond of wild-flowers.”
</p>
<p>
The whistle blew. There was a groan and
quiver as the train began to move, that drowned
the child’s gratitude. Miss Deering laid the roses
on the seat beside her with a curious touch, as if
she shrank from them. An hour or two ago she
had started on her journey, leaving behind her a
sweet dream of youth and love and roses. In
twenty-four hours the brightness of her life had
been swept away. The summer day wore a dulness
she had never seen before.
</p>
<p>
She was a handsome young girl, with a fine
complexion, light, silken soft hair, and very dark
gray eyes. A modern, stylish girl, who had not
yet reached the period when one begins to assert
her right supreme over the world and all that
therein is.
</p>
<p>
She peered at the newcomers at the next station.
No one wanted the seat, however. The
sweet wild roses, in all their shell-like transparency,
lay unheeded, drinking up the dewy crystal
drops that had been showered by mortal hands, as
well as dusky-fingered night. You would have
said she had a tender side, that could be keenly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span>
moved by beauty. Perhaps that was why she
glanced out of the window on the whirling sights.
She might have vaguely wondered if she had been
so utterly right yesterday—was it yesterday, or a
month ago?
</p>
<p>
She took up her book, but it had lost its interest.
The delicate fragrance of the roses disturbed
her—stirred a gust of feeling that she had fancied
securely laid. If <em>he</em> had cared, he would have come
last night; he would have seen her this morning at
the station. She had felt so strong, so justified in
her own sight, and such a simple thing as a beggar
with wild roses had disturbed it all.
</p>
<p>
There were not many people coming in town.
She glanced about—one and another had bunches
of flowers, flaunting scarlet geraniums and modern
things. Very few people cared for wild roses, unless
they were worked in table-scarfs or painted on
china. Ah, how the tender little buds crept closer
to each other! The pink, shell-like leaves of the
mothers drooped tiredly, the soft green huddled
about with a kind of frightened tenderness, as if
they might be going out in a strange, unfriendly
world. She turned her eyes away with a betraying
mistiness in them.
</p>
<p>
They came into the great station, but this was
not the hour for crowds. She picked up her
satchel, her book—should she leave the roses to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
the mercy of the sweeper? Something throbbed
up in her throat, she gathered them with a desperate
grasp, threaded her way through the great
enclosure, and passed out into the street amid a
babel of voices.
</p>
<p>
A group of ragged urchins stood eager for a
chance to seize a valise or parcel, to the relief or
disgust of its owner.
</p>
<p>
“Who wants some flowers?” bethinking herself
suddenly of the flower charities.
</p>
<p>
They thronged round her. She threw the bunch
with a light effort just beyond the first noisy ring.
A shock-headed lad with a broad, freckled face and
laughing blue eyes caught it. Another snatched
at it. Thereupon ensued a scrimmage. Blows
and tearing of hair were the courtesies exchanged,
until a policeman loomed in sight. The first lad
was at this moment the victor, and he plunged
down the side street with a fleetness known only
to the street arab. The majesty of the law distributed
cuffs liberally among the vanquished, and the
rabble dispersed.
</p>
<p>
Miss Deering smiled with a touch of sad scorn,
nodded to a cabman, and, as she seated herself,
watched the fleet but dirty feet vanishing in the
distance, recalling the face.
</p>
<p>
“It’s curious they, too, should quarrel about
wild roses,” she said, just under her breath, sighing
softly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile Patsey Muldoon ran some ten or
twelve squares, then paused for a bit of breath,
mopping his face with his ragged shirt sleeve.
</p>
<p>
“My, ain’t they queer? not stunners exactly,
but splendid, if they ain’t red. I d’know as Dil
ever see sich a swad in her life. An’ Bess’s blue
eyes’ll be like saucers. Oh, golly! how sweet!”
burying his face in them. “Sich as these ain’t
layin’ loose round Barker’s Court offen. I’ve lost
a job mebbe, an’ Casey’ll crow if he gits one; but
that ere left-hander wos science, that wos!” and
the boy chuckled as he ran on again.
</p>
<p>
From the Grand Central over to the East Side
tenements was no mean stretch, but Patsey would
have gone twice as far to give Dilsey Quinn a
pleasure.
</p>
<p>
The street was built up compactly, and swarmed
with children. There was an open way between
a row of houses, a flagged space called Barker’s
Court; a deep strip of ground that had been a
puzzle to its owner, until he hit upon a plan for
his model tenement row. The four-story houses
faced each other, with pulley-lines between, the
clothes shutting out air and light. They were
planned for the greatest number, if the greatest
good had been omitted. One narrow hall and
stairway did for two houses, so not much space
was lost. But the sights and sounds, the piles of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
garbage, the vile air emanating from rooms where
dirt reigned supreme, and the steam of the wet
clothes, were something terrible on a hot summer
day. The poor creatures crowded into it were
used to it.
</p>
<p>
Patsey ran down to the middle of the Court,
and then scudded up one flight.
</p>
<p>
The room was clean, rather cheery looking,
with one window, water and drain in the corner,
a room at the back, and a very small one at the
side over the hall, with a window half the width
of the other. A stove stood in the chimney recess,
there was an old lounge, a rug of crazy-work
carpet in which Dilsey Quinn had sewed together
the bits given to her mother.
</p>
<p>
“Hello, Dil! Ain’t them the daisies? Did
ye ever have sich a lot before in yer life? I don’t
mean they’re reg’lar daisies—they’re roses of
some kind, but blam’d if I ever seen any like ’em
afore.”
</p>
<p>
He tossed them into a baby-wagon, where sat the
frailest and whitest wraith one could ever imagine
alive. How she lived puzzled everybody. They
never took into account Dil’s passionate and inexhaustible
love that fought off death with eager,
watchful care.
</p>
<p>
“O Patsey!” Such a joyful cry of surprise.
“Was there a flower mission?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
</p>
<p>
“Flower mission be blowed! Did ye ever see
any sich in a mission by the time it gits round
here?”
</p>
<p>
His stubby nose wrinkled disdainfully, and he
gave his head an important toss.
</p>
<p>
“But, oh, where <em>did</em> you get thim?” There
was the least bit of a brogue in Dil’s voice, and
she always said “thim” in an odd, precise fashion.
“There must be a thousand; they’re packed so
tight they’ve almost hurted each other. And, oh,
how sweet!”
</p>
<p>
The breath of fragrance seemed to penetrate
every pulse in Dil’s sturdy frame.
</p>
<p>
“I guess ther ain’t mor’n a hundred; but it’s a
jolly lot, and they looked so strange and queer
like—weakly, like Bess here, an’ I thought of her.
A young lady throwed ’em out to me. I s’pose
she’d had so many flowers they didn’t count. My,
wasn’t she a high-stepper, purty as they make ’em;
but her hair couldn’t shine along o’ Bess’s here.
None o’ yer horse-car folks, nuther; she went
off in a cab. An’ Jim Casey went fer ’em. I
knowed she meant ’em fer me; ye kin tell by a
person’s eye an’ the nod o’ ther head. But Casey
went fer ’em, an’ I give him a punch jes’ back o’
the ear—clear science, an’ the boys made a row.
While the cop was a-mendin’ of their bangs I
shinned it off good, I tell ye! I’ve run every step
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
from Gran’ Cent’al, an now I must shin off fer
my papers. An’ you kids kin have a picnic wid
de flowers.”
</p>
<p>
Patsey stopped for a breath, redder than ever in
the face.
</p>
<p>
“O Patsey, you’re so good!” cried the little
wraith. Dil smiled through her tears, and
squeezed his hand.
</p>
<p>
“Hi! good!” with a snort of merry disdain.
“I jes’ wisht I had the boodle to git a kerrige
an’ take ye both out’n the country where things
grow reel in the ground, an’ ye can snivy on ’em
with no cop nosin’ round. If Bess could walk
we’d take a tower. But, tra la,” and his bare feet
went pattering down the stairs.
</p>
<p>
The two children looked at each other and the
roses in wordless amaze. Bess ventured to touch
one with her thin little fingers. Then the wail of
a baby broke into their speechless delight.
</p>
<p>
There were five babies sprawling on the floor
and the lounge, too near of an age to suggest their
belonging to one household. Since Dil had to be
kept at home with a poor sickly child who wouldn’t
die, Mrs. Quinn had found a way of making her
profitable besides keeping the house tidy and looking
after the meals. But it was not down in the
lists as a day nursery.
</p>
<p>
Dilsey Quinn was fourteen. You would not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
have supposed her that; but hard work, bad air,
and perhaps the lack of the natural joys of childhood,
had played havoc with her growth and the
graces of youth. She had rarely known what it
was to run and shout and play as even the street
arabs did. There had always been a big baby for
her to tend; for the Quinns came into the world
lusty and strong. Next to Dil had been a boy,
now safely landed in the reform-school after a
series of adventures such as are glorified in the
literature of the slums. Then Bess, and two more
boys, who bade fair to emulate their brother.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn was a fine, large Scotch-Irish woman;
Mr. Quinn a pure son of Erin, much given
to his cups, and able to pick a quarrel out of the
eye of a needle. One night, four years agone,
he had indulged in a glorious “shindy,” smashed
things in general, and little Bess in particular,
beat his wife nearly to a jelly, then rushed to the
nearest gin-mill, and half murdered the proprietor.
He was now doing the State service behind prison-bars.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn was an excellent laundress, and
managed better without him. But she, too, had a
weakness for a “sup o’ gin,” which she always
took after her day’s work and before she went to
bed. But woe betide the household when she began
too early in the day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
</p>
<p>
The baby that set up such a howl was a fat,
yellowish-white, small-eyed creature, looking like
a great, soggy, overboiled potato.
</p>
<p>
“There, Jamsie, there,” began the little mother
soothingly; “would he like a turn in the baby-jumper?
He’s tired sitting on the floor, ain’t he,
Jamsie?”
</p>
<p>
The cooing voice and the tender clasp comforted
the poor baby. She placed him in the
jumper, and gave him an iron spoon, with which
he made desperate lunges at the baby nearest him.
But Dil fenced him off with a chair. She gave
another one a crust to munch on. The two on
the lounge were asleep; the other was playing
with the spokes of Bess’s wheel.
</p>
<p>
Dil always had a “way” with babies. It might
have been better for her if she had proved less
beguiling. Sometimes the number swelled to ten,
but it was oftener five or six. If it fell below five
there were hard lines for poor Dil, unless she had a
reserve fund. She early learned the beneficent
use of strategy in the way of “knock-downs.”
</p>
<p>
“O Dil!” and Bess gave a long, rapturous sigh,
“did you ever see so many? And they’re real
roses, but fine and tender and strange, somehow.
The buds are like babies,—no, they’re prittier
than babies,” glancing disdainfully at those around
her; “but rose babies would be prittier and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
sweeter, wouldn’t they?” with a wan little smile.
“O my darlings, I must kiss you! Thank you
a thousand, thousand times. Did the pritty lady
guess you were coming to me?” She buried her
face down deep in their sweetness, and every faint,
feeble pulse thrilled with wordless delight.
</p>
<p>
“It was awful good of Patsey, wasn’t it?” she
continued, when she looked up again.
</p>
<p>
“Patsey’s always good,” answered Dil sententiously.
She was wondering what they would do
if he should get “nabbed” by any untoward accident;
for every little while some boy did get
“nabbed.”
</p>
<p>
Patsey Muldoon smoked cigar stumps, fought
like a tiger, and swore as only a street-gamin can.
But he was not a thief. And to these two girls
he was as loyal a knight, and brave, as any around
King Arthur’s Table.
</p>
<p>
“Let me untie thim. They must be hurted
with the string round so tight.”
</p>
<p>
Dil cut the cord, and began to unwind it. A
great shower fell over Bess, who laughed softly,
and uttered exclamations in every key of delight.
If Virginia Deering could have witnessed the rapture
of these poor things over her despised wild
roses!
</p>
<p>
“O Dil, we never had so many flowers all to
once!” she cried in tremulous joy. “There was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>
the daisies from the Mission; but though they’re
pritty, you can’t make ’em smell sweet. Do you
s’pose it was over in that country you heard tell
of where the beautiful lady found them? O Dil,
if you could go to the Mission School again! I’d
like to know some more,—oh, what will we do
with them?”
</p>
<p>
Dil looked round in dismay.
</p>
<p>
“I daren’t use the pitcher, and there ain’t
nothin’ big enough. They’re wilty, and they just
want to be laid out straight in water. But if
they’re in anything, and mammy wants it, she’ll
just chuck thim away. Oh, dear!” and Dil
glanced round in perplexity.
</p>
<p>
“Mammy promised to buy me another bowl,
but she never does,” was Bess’s plaint.
</p>
<p>
Some one had given them a white earthen
wash-bowl long before. The boys had broken it
in a “tussle.” They were thrashed, but Bess had
not had her loss made good.
</p>
<p>
“O Bess! would you mind if I ran down to
Misses Finnigan’s? She might have something—cheap.”
</p>
<p>
“No; run quick,” was the eager response.
</p>
<p>
Dil gave a glance at the babies and was off.
Around the corner in a basement was a small
store of odds and ends. Mrs. Finnigan was
a short, shrewd-looking woman with very red
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
hair, a much turned-up nose, and one squint
eye.
</p>
<p>
Dil studied the shelves as they were passing
the time of day.
</p>
<p>
“What will wan of thim little wash-bowls
cost?” she asked hesitatingly. “Bess had wan
a lady sent to her, but Owny broke it. I’ve been
looking to get her another, but it’s so hard to
save up a bit o’ money.”
</p>
<p>
“Ah, yis; so it is.” Mrs. Finnigan gave the
shelf a severe scrutiny. “Thim, is it now? Well,
there’s wan ye kin hev’ fer sivin cints, dirt chape
at that. It’s got a bit of scale knocked off, and
the dust has settled in, but it’ll hould wather
ivery blissid time,” and she laughed with a funny
twinkle in her squint eye. “Or will ye be wantin’
somethin’ foiner?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, and I’ve only five cents. If you will
trust me a bit”—eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Sure I’d trust ye to Christmas an’ the day
afther, Dilsey Quinn. If iverybody was as honest,
I’d be puttin’ money in the bank where I’m
bewailin’ me bad debts now! Take it along wid
ye.”
</p>
<p>
“O Misses Finnigan, if mother should be
awful about it, might I just say ye gev it to me?
Mother do be moighty queer sometimes, and
other whiles she don’t notice.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
</p>
<p>
“That I will, an’ the blissid Virgin’ll count it
no sin. It’s a long head ye’ve got, Dil, an’ its
wisdom that gets through the world widout havin’
it broken. It’ll be all right”—with another
wink. “An’ here’s a bit of bananny for the poor
colleen.”
</p>
<p>
Dil ran off home with the bowl wrapped up in
her apron to prevent incautious gossip. One of
the babies was crying, but she hushed it with the
end of the banana. It was rather “off,” and the
middle had to be amputated, but the baby enjoyed
the unwonted luxury.
</p>
<p>
Then she washed her bowl and filled it with
clean water.
</p>
<p>
“They’ll freshen up, and the buds be comin’ out
every day. I’ll set thim on the window-sill, and
all night they’ll be sweet to you between whiles,
when you can’t sleep. O Bess dear, do you mind
the old lady who came in with her trax, I think
she called thim, and sung in her trembly voice
’bout everlastin’ spring an’ never with’rin’ flowers?
I’ve always wisht I could remember more
of it. Never with’rin’ flowers! Think how lovely
’twould be!”
</p>
<p>
“An’—heaven! That’s what it is, Dil. I
wisht some one else could know. O Dil, think of
flowers always stayin’ fresh an’ sweet!”
</p>
<p>
Dil snipped off the faded leaves, and gave them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
a fresh water bath. One branch had seven buds
and five roses. The delight that stirred these
starved souls was quite indescribable. Never had
they possessed such a wealth of pleasure.
</p>
<p>
Now and then Dil had to leave off and comfort
the fractious babies. They were getting tired,
and wanted their own mothers. But for the poor
little girl playing at motherhood there was no one
to come in and infold her in restful arms, and
comfort her when the long, warm day ended.
</p>
<p>
At last she had the bowl filled with flowers, a
great mound of delicious pink and tenderest green.
Bess and Dilsey knew little about artistic methods;
but the sight was a joy that the finest knowledge
could not have described—that full, wordless
satisfaction.
</p>
<p>
A passionate pulsation throbbed in Bess’s throat
as if it would strangle her.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said Dil, “I’m going to set thim in
your room. I’ll push you in there, and you can
make believe you are in a truly garden. For
whin the folks come in, they’ll be beggin’ thim,
an’ they’ll give thim to the babies to tear up.
I couldn’t abear to have thim hurted. An’ babies
don’t care!”
</p>
<p>
“They can go out every day and see things.”
Bess clasped her arms about Dil’s neck, and kissed
her fervently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
</p>
<p>
The room was very, very small. Dil’s cot stood
along the wall; and there were two or three grocery
boxes piled up to make a sort of closet, with
a faded curtain across it. There was just room
to push in the carriage by the window. It was
Bess’s sofa by day and bed by night. The bowl
was placed on the window-sill. Now and then a
breath of air found its way in.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Finn and Mrs. Brady came in for their
babies. Dil stirred the fire and put on the
kettle, then washed the potatoes and set them
to cook. Now and then she ran in to smile at
Bess.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just like heaven!” cried the little wraith.
</p>
<p>
Alas, if this was a foretaste of heaven! This
close, fetid air, and the wet clothes, for they were
put up at all hours. Pure air was one of the luxuries
Barker’s Court could not indulge in, though
we talk of it being God’s gift to rich and poor
alike.
</p>
<p>
When the two rough, begrimed boys rushed
in there was only Jamsie left; and he was in an
uneasy sleep, with his thumb in his mouth, so Dil
held up her hand to entreat silence. The boys
lived so generally in the street, and did so much
shrewd foraging, that they looked well and hearty,
if they had the air of prospective toughs.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve put the last bit of bread in the milk for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
Bess’s supper, and you must wait until mother
comes,” said Dil, with her small air of authority.
</p>
<p>
The boys grumbled. Little Dan was quick to
follow Owen’s lead, who said roughly,—
</p>
<p>
“O yes, de kid must have everything! An’
she’ll never be good fer nothin’ wid dem legs.
No use tryin’ to fatten her up wid de luxuries o’
life!” and the boy’s swagger would have done
credit to his father.
</p>
<p>
“She’s no good,” put in Dan; “’n’ I’m norful
hungry.”
</p>
<p>
The tears came to Dil’s eyes, though she was
quite used to hearing such remarks on the little
sister she loved better than her own life. Everybody
seemed to consider her such a useless burthen.
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t them praties done? I could jes’ eat ’em
raw,” whined Dan.
</p>
<p>
“Shet yer mug, er I’ll gev ye a swipe,” said
Owen. “Ye don’t look’s if ye wos goin’ to faint
this minnit.”
</p>
<p>
“You jes’ mind yer own biz, Owen Quinn;”
and the little fellow swelled up with an air.
</p>
<p>
Owen made a dive, but Dan was like an eel.
They were on the verge of a scrimmage when
their mother entered. A tall, brawny woman,
with an abundance of black hair, blue eyes, and a
color that, in her girlhood, had made her the belle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
of her native hamlet, less than twenty years ago.
A hard, weather-beaten look had settled in the
lines of her face, her cheeks had an unwholesome
redness, her skin had the sodden aspect that hot
steam brings about, and her eyes were a little
bleared by her frequent potations. Her voice
was loud, and carried a covert threat in it. She
cuffed the boys, produced a loaf of bread, and
some roast beef bones Mrs. Collins had given
her.
</p>
<p>
“It just needs a stir in the kettle, Dil, for it’s
gone a bit sour; but it’ll freshen up with salt an’
some onion. How many babies?”
</p>
<p>
“Five,” answered Dil.
</p>
<p>
Just then Mrs. Gillen came flying up the stairs.
She was not much beyond twenty, and still comely
with youth and health and hope.
</p>
<p>
“O me darlint!” snatching up her baby with
rapture, “did he want his own mammy, sure?”
laughing gleefully between the kisses. “Has he
fretted any, Dil?”
</p>
<p>
“He’s been very good.” Dil was too wise to
tell bad tales.
</p>
<p>
“He always is, the darlint! An’ I’m late. I
was ironin’ away for dear life, whin Mrs. Welford
comes down wid a lasht summer’s gown, an’ sez
she, ‘Mrs. Gillen, you stop an’ iron it, an’ I’ll
give ye a quarther, for ye’ve had a big day’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
work,’ sez she. So what cud I do, faix, when she
shpoke so cliver loike, an’ the money ready to
hand?”
</p>
<p>
“They’re not often so free wid their tin,
though heaven knows they’re free enough wid
their work,” commented Mrs. Quinn, with a touch
of contempt.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Welford is a rale lady, ivery inch of her.
Jamsie grumbles that I go to her, but a bit o’ tin
comes in moighty handy. An’ many’s the cast-offs
I do be getten, an’ it all helps. Here’s five
cints, and here’s a nickel for yourself, Dil. Whatever
in the world should we be doin’ widout
ye?”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, ma’am,” and Dil courtesied.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Gillen bundled up her baby in her apron
and wished them good-night, skipping home with
a light heart to get her husband’s supper, and
hear him scold a little because she worked so
late.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn held out her hand to her daughter.
</p>
<p>
“Gev me that nickel,” she said.
</p>
<p>
The ready obedience was inspired more by the
fear of a blow than love.
</p>
<p>
The potatoes were done, and they sat down to
supper. Certainly the boys <em>were</em> hungry.
</p>
<p>
“I’m goin’ to step down to Mrs. MacBride’s an’
sit on the stoop for a bit of fresh air,” she announced.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
“I’ve worked that hard to-day there’s
no life left in me. Don’t ye dare to stir out, ye
spalpeens, or I’ll break ivery blessed bone in your
body,” and Mrs. Gillen shook her fist by way of
a parting injunction.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>II—SATURDAY AFTERNOON</h2>
<p>
The boys waited until they were sure their
mother was having her evening treat. Mrs. MacBride’s
was a very fascinating place, a sort of
woman’s club-house, with a sprinkling of men to
make things merry. Decent, too, as drinking-places
go. No dancing girls, but now and then
a rather broad joke, and a song that would not
appeal to a highly cultivated taste. There was
plenty of gossip, but the hours were not long.
</p>
<p>
Dil washed up the dishes, dumped the stove-grate,
and took the ashes out to the box. Then
she swept up the room and set the table, and her
day’s work was done.
</p>
<p>
Patsey Muldoon came in with his heartsome
laugh.
</p>
<p>
“O Patsey, they’re the loveliest things, all coming
up so fresh an’ elegant, as if they grew in the
water. Bess is wild about thim;” and Dil’s tone
was brimful of joy.
</p>
<p>
They went in and sat on the cot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
</p>
<p>
“They do seem alive,” declared Bess, with her
thin, quivering note of satisfaction. “I do be
talkin’ to thim all the time, as if they were
folks.”
</p>
<p>
Patsey laughed down into the large, eager,
faded eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Sure, it’s fine as a queen in her garden ye
are! We’ll say thanky to my lady for not kapin’
them herself. An’ I had a streak of luck this
avenin’, an’ I bought the weeny thing two of the
purtiest apples I could find. I was goin’ to git a
norange, but the cheek of ’em, wantin’ five cents
for wan!”
</p>
<p>
“I like the apples best, Patsey,” replied the
plaintive little voice. “You’re so good!”
</p>
<p>
“I had one mesilf, an’ it’s first-rate. Casey’s
goin’ ter lick me—don’t yer wish him luck?”
</p>
<p>
Patsey laughed again. He seemed much
amused over the fact.
</p>
<p>
“No, I don’t,” said Dil stoutly. “Was it ’bout
the flowers?” and Dil began to peel the soft harvest
apple, looking up with eager interest.
</p>
<p>
“The cop gev him a clip, an’ he was mad all
through.” Patsey nodded humorously.
</p>
<p>
“What would he have done with the roses?”
Dil asked, with pity in her voice.
</p>
<p>
“Taken ’em to his best gal!” This seemed an
immense joke to the boy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
</p>
<p>
“An’ I’m your best girl, Patsey,” said Bess,
laying her little hand on his, so brown.
</p>
<p>
“That you jest are, an’ don’t yer forgit it,” he
replied heartily.
</p>
<p>
Dil fed her with slices of the apple. It was
so refreshing to her parched mouth and throat.
Patsey had so many amusing incidents to relate;
but he always slipped away early, before the boys
came home. He wanted no one telling tales.
</p>
<p>
Then Dil gave Bess her evening bath, and
rubbed the shrunken legs that would never even
hold up the wasted body. Ah, how softly Dil
took them in her hands, how tender and loving
were her ministrations. All her soul went out in
this one passionate affection.
</p>
<p>
“Your poor flannils is all in rags,” she said
pityingly. “Whatever we are to do unless some
one gives mammy a lot of old stuff. O Bess!
And there are such lovely ones in the stores, soft
as a pussy cat.”
</p>
<p>
“Mine are cool for summer.” Bess gave a pitiful
little laugh. Buying clothes for her was a
sheer waste, in her mother’s estimation.
</p>
<p>
Then Dil held the thin hands and fanned her
while she crooned, in a sort of monotone, bits of
beautiful sentences she had gathered in her infrequent
inspection of windows where Christmas or
Easter cards were displayed. She could not carry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
the simplest tune, to her passionate regret, but
she might have improvised chanting sentences
and measures that would have delighted a composer.
She had transformed Bess’s pillowed
couch into a bed, and these hot nights she
fanned her until she drowsed away herself. She
used to get so tired, poor hard-worked Dilsey.
</p>
<p>
But the pathetic minor key of her untrained
and as yet unfound voice Bess thought the sweetest
music in the world. She was not fond of the
gay, blatant street songs; her nerves were too
sensitive, her ear too finely attuned to unconscious
harmonies.
</p>
<p>
The tired voice faltered, the weary head drooped,
the soft voice ceased.
</p>
<p>
Bess roused her.
</p>
<p>
“Dil, dear, you must go to bed. I am all nice
and cooled off now, and you are so tired. Kiss me
once more.”
</p>
<p>
Not once but many times. Then she dropped
on her own little bed and was asleep in a moment.
Did God, with all his millions to care for, care also
for these heathens in a great enlightened city?
</p>
<p>
It was Bess who heard the boys scuffling in and
just saving themselves when their mother’s heavy
tread sounded in the room. It was the poor child,
racked by pain, whose nerves were rasped by the
brawls and the crying babies, the oaths and foul
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
language, and sometimes a fight that seemed in
her very window.
</p>
<p>
Yet she lay there with her bowl of roses beside
her, now and then touching them caressingly with
her slight fingers, and inhaling the delicate fragrance.
She was in a little realm of her own,
unknowingly the bit of the kingdom of heaven
within one.
</p>
<p>
But Bessy Quinn did not even know that she
had a soul. There was a great hungry longing
for some clean and quiet comfort, a mother she
was not always afraid of, and Dil, who was never
to tend babies any more. And if there could be
flowers, and the “everlasting spring,” and one
could live out in the green fields.
</p>
<p>
They talked it over sometimes—this wonderful
place they would like to find.
</p>
<p>
Morning always came too soon for Dilsey Quinn.
Her mother wanted a cup of coffee, and ordered
what Dil was to cook for the boys. It was a
relief to see her go; but the babies began to come
in at seven, and sometimes they were cross and
cried after their mothers.
</p>
<p>
But on Saturday there was a great change.
Mrs. Quinn washed at home; Dilsey scrubbed
the floors, ironed, was maid of all work, for there
was not often any babies; Mrs. Quinn did not
enjoy having them around.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
</p>
<p>
This afternoon she was going to “Cunny Island”
with a party of choice spirits. She felt she needed
an outing once a week, and five days’ steady washing
and ironing was surely enough. Dil helped
her mother off with alacrity. This time she was
unusually good-natured, and gave the children a
penny all round.
</p>
<p>
Then Dil arrayed herself and Bess in their best.
Dil was quite well off this summer; her mother
often brought home clothes she could wear. But
poor Bess had not been so fortunate. The little
white cap was daintily done up, though Dil knew
it would never stand another ironing. So with
the dress, and the faded blue ribbon tied about
her baby waist. They were scrupulously clean;
one would have wondered how anything so neat
could have come out of Barker’s Court.
</p>
<p>
It was a feat of ingenuity for Dil’s short arms
to get the carriage down the narrow, winding
stairs. Sometimes the boys would help, or Patsey
would be there. Then she took the pillows and
the faded rug, and when they were settled she
carried down Bess. That was not a heavy
burthen. She arranged her in a wonderful manner,
pulling out the soft golden curls that were
like spun silk. Bess would have been lovely in
health and prosperity. Her blue eyes had black
pupils and dark outside rims. Between was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
light, translucent blue, changing like a sea wave
blown about. The brows and lashes were dark.
But the face had a wan, worn look, and the pleading
baby mouth had lost its color, the features
were sharpened.
</p>
<p>
One and another gave them good-day with a
pleasant smile.
</p>
<p>
“It would be the Lord’s mercy if the poor thing
could drop off quiet like,” they said to each other.
It was a mystery to them how she managed to
live.
</p>
<p>
They went out of the slums into heaven almost;
over to Madison Square. Dil liked the broad out-look,
the beautiful houses, the stores, the perspective
of diverging streets, the throngs of people, the
fountain, the flowers. There was an intangible
influence for which her knowledge was too limited;
but her inmost being felt, if it could not understand.
Occasionally, like poor Joe, she was
ordered to move on, but one policeman never
molested her. Something in the pathetic baby
face recalled one he had held in his arms, and who
had gone out of them to her little grave.
</p>
<p>
Dil found a shady place and a vacant seat. She
drew the wagon up close, resting her feet on the
wheel. The last of the wild roses had been taken
along for an airing. Poor, shrunken little buds,
lacking strength to come out fully, akin to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
fingers that held them so tenderly. Bess laughed
at Dil’s shrewd, amusing comments, and they were
very happy.
</p>
<p>
Two or three long, delicious hours in this fresh,
inspiriting air, with the blue sky over their heads,
the patches of velvety grass, the waving trees, the
elusive tints caught by the spray of the fountain,
and the flowers, made a paradise for them. They
drank in eagerly the divine draught that was to
last them a week, perhaps longer.
</p>
<p>
A young fellow came sauntering along,—a
tall, supple, jaunty-looking man, with a refined
and kindly, rather than a handsome face. His
hair was cropped close, there was a line of sunny
brown moustache on his short upper lip, and his
chin was broad and cleft. It gave him a mirthful
expression, as if he might smile easily; but there
was a shadow of firmness in the blue-gray eye,
and now the lips were set resolutely.
</p>
<p>
He stopped and studied them. They were like
a picture in their unconventional grace. He was
quite in the habit of picking up odd, rustic ideas.
</p>
<p>
“Hillo!” coming nearer with a bright smile.
“Where did you youngsters find wild roses?
They seem not to have thriven on city air.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Are</em> they <em>wild</em> roses?” asked Dil. “What
makes thim so?”
</p>
<p>
He laughed, a soft, alluring sound. Something
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
in the quaint voice attracted him. It was too old,
too intense, for a child.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know, except that they <em>are</em> wild around
country places, and do not take kindly to civilization.
Where I have been staying, there are hundreds
of them. You can’t tell much about beauty
by those withered-up buds.”
</p>
<p>
“O mister, we had thim when they were lovely.
On Chuesday it was—Patsey Muldoon brought
thim to us. And they just seemed to make Bess
all alive again with joy.”
</p>
<p>
The pretty suggestion of brogue, the frankness,
so far removed from any aspect of boldness, interested
him curiously.
</p>
<p>
“And had Patsey Muldoon been in the country?”
he asked with interest.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no. He was up to Gran’ Cent’l, an’ a lady
who come on the train had thim. Patsey said she
was beautiful and elegant, an’ she gev thim to
him. An’ Jim Casey tried to get ’em, an’ they
had a scrimmage; but Patsey ain’t no chump!
An’ he brought thim down to Bess,” nodding to
the pale little wraith. “Patsey’s so good to us!
An’, oh, they was so lovely an’ sweet, with leaves
like beautiful pink satin, and eyes that looked at
you like humans,—prittier than most humans.
An’ it was like a garden to us—a great bowlful.
Wasn’t it, Bess?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
</p>
<p>
The child smiled, and raised her eyes in exaltation.
Preternaturally bright they were, with the
breathless look that betrays the ebbing shore of
life, yet full of eager desire to remain. For there
would have been no martyrdom equal to being
separated from Dil.
</p>
<p>
“O mister!” she cried beseechingly, “couldn’t
you tell us about them—how they live in their
own homes? An’ how they get that soft, satiny
color? Mammy brought us home a piece of ribbon
once,—some one gev it to her,—an’ Dil
made a bow for my cap. Last summer, wasn’t it,
Dil? An’ the roses were just like that when we
freshened them up. They was so lovely!”
</p>
<p>
He seated himself beside Dil. A curious impression
came over him, and he was touched to
the heart by the fondness and tender care of the
roses. Was there some strange link—
</p>
<p>
“Was it Tuesday afternoon, did you say?” hesitating,
with a sudden rush at his heart. “And a
tall, slim girl with light hair?”
</p>
<p>
Dil shook her head with vague uncertainty.
“Patsey said she was a stunner! An’ she went
in a kerrige. She wasn’t no car folks.”
</p>
<p>
He laughed softly at this idea of superiority.
“Of course <em>you</em> didn’t see her,” he commented
reflectively, with a pleasant nod. How absurd to
catch at such a straw. No, he couldn’t fancy <em>her</em>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
with a great bunch of wild roses in her slim hand,
when she had so haughtily taken off his ring and
dropped it at his feet.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you wanted to know about wild roses
when they were at home,” coming out of his
dream. What a dainty conceit it was! And he
could see the pretty rose nook now; yes, it was a
summer parlor. “Well, they grow about country
ways. I’ve found them in the woods, by the
streams, by the roadsides, sometimes in great
clumps. And where I have been staying,—in
the village of Chester,—a long distance from
here, they grew in abundance. At the edge of a
wood there was a rose thicket. The great, tall
ones that meet over your head, and the low-growing
bushy ones. Why, you could gather them by
the hundreds! Have you ever been to the country?”
he asked suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve been to Cent’l Park,” answered Dil
proudly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, that’s the country in its Sunday clothes,
dressed up for a company reception. The real
country lives in every-day clothes, and gets weedy
and dusty, with roads full of ruts. But you can
walk on the grass; it grows all along the roadsides.
Then there are flowers,—or weeds in
bloom; it amounts to the same thing,—and no
one scolds if you pick them. You can lie out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
under the trees, and the birds come and sing to
you, and the squirrels run about. The air is
sweet as if it rained cologne every night. Under-brush
and wild blackberries reach out and shake
hands with you; butterflies go floating in the sunshine;
crickets sit on the stones and chirp; bees
go droning by, laden with honey; and a great
robin will stop and wink at you.”
</p>
<p>
The children’s faces were not only a study, but
a revelation. John Travis thought he had never
seen anything so wonderful. If a man could put
such life in every feature, such exquisite bewilderment!
</p>
<p>
“What <em>is</em> a robin?” asked Bess, her face all
alight with eagerness.
</p>
<p>
“A great saucy bird with black eyes and a red
breast. And there is a bobolink, who flies around
announcing his own name, and a tiny bird that
says, ‘Phebe, Phebe;’ for in the country the birds
can talk.”
</p>
<p>
Both children sighed; their hearts were full to
overflowing. What heavenly content!
</p>
<p>
“This particular spot,” and John Travis’s eyes
seemed to look way off and soften mysteriously,
“is at the edge of a wood. The road runs so,”
marking it out on his trousers with his finger,
“way up over a sloping hill, and this one goes
down to a little stream. In this angle—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
</p>
<p>
Neither of them had the slightest idea of an
angle, but it did not disturb their delight.
</p>
<p>
“In this angle there are some alders and stuff,
and a curious little entrance to the rose thicket.
Every kind seems in a riotous tangle. The low
ones that begin to bloom in June, palest pink,
rose-pink, and their dainty slim buds the most delicious
color imaginable. There’s a small cleared
space; that’s the parlor, with a velvety green carpet.
The bushes meet overhead, and shower their
soft leaves down over you. Every day hundreds
of them bloom. It looks like a fairy cave. And
lying down on the grass you can look up to one
patch of blue sky. And I think the roses must
have souls that go up to heaven—they are so
sweet.”
</p>
<p>
He paused in his random talk, with his eyes
fixed on Dil. The rapt expression of her face
transfigured her. Any one could imagine Bess
being beautiful under certain healthful conditions,
but Dil gave no promise to the casual glance.
John Travis discerned at that moment the gift
and charm higher than mere beauty, born of the
soul, and visible only when the soul is deeply
moved.
</p>
<p>
Her hat was pushed a little back. There was a
fringe of red-brown hair with a peculiar glint,
softened by the summer heat into rings. A low,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
broad forehead, a straight line of bronze brown,
shading off in a delicate curve and fineness at
the temple. But her eyes were like the gems in
brown quartz, that have a prisoned gleam of sunshine
in them, visible only in certain lights. Ordinarily
they were rather dull; at times full of
obstinate repression. Now they were illuminated
with the sunrise glow. A small Irish nose, that
had an amusing fashion of wrinkling up, and over
which went a tiny procession of freckles. A wide
mouth, redeemed by a beautifully curved upper
lip, and a rather square chin that destroyed the
oval.
</p>
<p>
“Hillo!” as if coming out of a dream. “See
here, I’d like to sketch you—would you mind?”
</p>
<p>
He had dreamed over a picture he was to paint
of that enchanted spot, a picture of happy youth
and love and hope, “In Wild-Rose Time.” But
the dream was dead, the inspiration ended. He
could never paint <em>that</em> picture, and yet so much
of his best efforts had gone to the making of it!
What if he arose from the ruin, and put this child
in it, with her marvellous eyes, her ignorant, innocent
trust, her apron full of wild roses, emerging
from the shadowy hollow, and one branch caught
in her hair, half crowning her.
</p>
<p>
For why should a man wreck his life on the
shallows and quicksands of a woman’s love? Two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
days ago he had said he could not paint again in
years, if ever, that all his genius had been the soft
glamour of a woman’s smile. And here was a fresh
inspiration.
</p>
<p>
Dil stared, yet the happy light did not go out
of her face as she tried to grasp the mystery.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; would you mind my sketching you for a
picture?”
</p>
<p>
There were not many people around. Saturday
afternoons they went off on excursions. A few
drowsy old fellows of the better class, two women
resting and reading, waiting for some one perhaps,
others sauntering.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if you’d make a picture of Bess! She’s
so much prittier, an’ her hair’s like gold. Oh,
do!” and Dil’s breath came with an entreating
gasp, while her face was beseeching love.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; I’ll make a picture of Bess too, if you
can stay long enough,” he answered good humoredly.
</p>
<p>
“We can stay till dark, ’f we like. Summer
nights ain’t never lonesome. An’ Sat’day’s full
of folks.”
</p>
<p>
Travis laughed. “All right. Push your hat
up higher—so. No, let your hair stay tumbled.”
</p>
<p>
“It isn’t pritty hair. They used to call me red-top,
an’ names. ’Tain’t so red as it was.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
She ran her fingers through it, and gave her
head a shake.
</p>
<p>
“Capital.” He had just drawn out his sketch-book,
when the policeman came down with a solemn
tread and authoritative countenance. But
Travis nodded, and gave him an assuring smile
that all was right.
</p>
<p>
“Let me see; I think I’ll tell you about an
old apple orchard I know. You never saw one in
bloom?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, do apples have flowers?” cried Bess.
“There’s never any such in the stores. What
a wonderful thing country must be!”
</p>
<p>
“The blossom comes first, then the fruit.”
Then he began with the fascinating preface:
“When I was a little boy I had been ill a long
while with scarlet fever. It was the middle of
May when I was taken to the country.”
</p>
<p>
What a wonderful romance he made of bloom
and bird music, of chickens and cows, of lambs,
of the little colt that ran in the orchard, so very
shy at first, and then growing so tame that the
little lad took him for a playfellow. Very simple
indeed, but he held his small audience entranced.
The delight in Bess’s face seemed to bring fine
and tender expressions to that of Dil. Her nose
wrinkled piquantly, her lips fell into beguiling
curves. Travis found himself speculating upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
the capacity of the face under the influence of
cultivation, education, and happiness. He really
hated to leave off, there were so many inspiring
possibilities.
</p>
<p>
Now and then some one gave them a sidelong
glance of wonder; but Travis went on in a steady,
business-like manner; and the guardian of the
square shielded them from undue curiosity.
</p>
<p>
“Bess isn’t well,” he said presently. “She
looks like a little ghost.”
</p>
<p>
“She was hurted a long while ago and she can’t
walk. Her little legs is just like a baby’s, an’
they never grow any more. But she won’t grow
either, and I don’t so much mind so long as I can
carry her.”
</p>
<p>
“Will she never walk again?” he asked in surprise.
“How old is she?”
</p>
<p>
“She’s ten; but she’s littler than the boys now,
so she’s the baby—the sweetest baby of thim
all.”
</p>
<p>
Ah, what a wealth of love spoke in the tone, in
the simple words.
</p>
<p>
“I think you may take off Bess’s cap,” he said,
with an unconsciously tender manner. Poor little
girl! And yet it could not be for very long. He
noted the lines made by suffering, and his heart
went out in sympathy.
</p>
<p>
“Now, if there is anything you would like to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
ask me—anything that puzzles you”—and he
reflected that most things might seem mysteries
to their untrained brains.
</p>
<p>
They glanced at each other and drew long
breaths, as if this was the golden opportunity
they had long waited for. Then an irresistibly
shy, sweet, beseeching expression crossed Bess’s
face, as her eyes wandered from him to her
sister.
</p>
<p>
“O Dil—you might ast him ’bout—you
know”—hesitating with pitiful eagerness in her
large eyes—“’bout goin’ to heaven, an’ how far
it is.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know where heaven is, mister?”
</p>
<p>
The question was asked with the good faith of
utter ignorance; but there was an intense and
puzzled anxiety in every line of the child’s countenance.
</p>
<p>
“Heaven!” He was struck with a strange
mental helplessness. “Heaven!” he repeated.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t anybody know for true?” A despair
quenched the sunshine in the brown eyes and
made outer darkness.
</p>
<p>
“An’ how they get there?” continued Bess
breathlessly. “That’s what we wanter know,
’cause Dil wants to go an’ take me. Is it very,
very far?”
</p>
<p>
Travis glanced at Dil. Never in his life had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
he been more at loss. There was a line between
her brows, and the wrinkled nose added to the
weight of thoughtfulness. Never had he seen a
few wrinkles express so much.
</p>
<p>
She felt as if he was questioning her.
</p>
<p>
“I went to the Mission School, you see,” she
began to explain. “The teacher read about a
woman who took her children an’ a girl who
lived with her, an’ started for heaven. Then
Owny took my shoes, ’cause ’twas wet an’ slushy
’n’ I couldn’t go, an’ so I didn’t hear if they got
there. ’N’ when I went again, that teacher had
gone away. I didn’t like the new wan. When
I ast her she said it was a gory somethin’, an’
you didn’t go that way to heaven now.”
</p>
<p>
“An allegory, yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, what’s that?”
</p>
<p>
“A story of something that <em>may</em> happen, like
every-day events.” Ah, how could he meet the
comprehension of these innocent children?
</p>
<p>
“Well, did she get there?” with eager haste.
</p>
<p>
The sparrows went on with their cheerful,
rather aggressive chirp. The fountain played,
people passed to and fro, and wagons rumbled;
but it seemed to John Travis as if there were
only themselves in the wide world—and God.
He did not understand God, but he knew then
there was some supreme power above man.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” with reverent gentleness, “yes, she
found heaven.”
</p>
<p>
“Then, what’s to hinder us, Dil? ’Twouldn’t
be any use to ast mother—she’d rather go to
Cunny Island or Mis’ MacBride’s. If you only
would tell us the way—”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; if you <em>could</em> tell us the way,” said Dil
wistfully, raising her entreating eyes.
</p>
<p>
Could he direct any one on the road to heaven?
And then he admitted to himself that he had cast
away the faint clew of years agone, and would not
know what step to take first.
</p>
<p>
“You see,” explained Dil hurriedly, “I thought
when we’d found just how to go, I’d take Bess
some Sunday mornin’, an’ we’d go up by Cent’l
Park and over by the river, ’cause they useter
sing ‘One more river to cross.’ Then we’d get
on a ferry-boat. Mother wouldn’t care much.
She don’t care for Bess since she’s hurted, and
won’t never be no good. But I could take care of
her; an’ when we struck the right way, ’twould be
just goin’ straight along. I could scrub an’ ’tend
babies an’ sweep an’ earn some money. People
was good to the woman in the story, an’ mebbe
they’d be good to us when we were on the road
an’ no mistake. If we could just get started.”
</p>
<p>
Oh, the eager, appealing desire in her face, the
faith and fervor in her voice! A poor little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
pilgrim, not even knowing what the City of Destruction
meant, longing with all her soul to set out
for that better country, and take her poor little
crippled sister. It moved him beyond anything
he had ever known, and blurred the sunshine with
a tremulous mistiness.
</p>
<p>
Dil was watching the varying expressions.
</p>
<p>
“O mister, ain’t there any heaven? Will we
have to go on living in Barker’s Court forever
’n’ ever?”
</p>
<p>
The despair in Dil’s voice was heartrending.
John Travis thought he had passed one hour of
crucial anguish; but it was as nothing to this, inasmuch
as the pang of the soul must exceed the
purely physical pain. He drew a long, quivering
breath.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, there ain’t any!”
</p>
<p>
He was on the witness stand. To destroy their
hope would be a crueler murder than that of the
innocents. No, he dared not deny God.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>III—THE WAY TO HEAVEN</h2>
<p>
John Travis was like a good many young men
in the tide of respectable church-going. His
grandmother was an old-fashioned Christian,
rather antiquated now; but he still enjoyed the
old cottage and the orchard of long ago. His
mother was a modern church member. They
never confessed their experiences one to another
in the fervent spiritual manner, but had clubs and
guilds and societies to train the working-people.
She was interested in charitable institutions, in
homes, and the like; that is, she subscribed liberally
and supervised them. Personally she was
rather disgusted with the inmates and their woes,
whose lives and duties were mapped out by rule,
whether they fitted or not.
</p>
<p>
Then, he had two sisters who were nice, wholesome,
attractive girls, who danced all winter in
silks and laces, kept Lent rigorously with early
services, sewing-classes, and historical lectures,
and took their turns in visiting the slums. All
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
summer there was pleasuring. The young women
in their “set” were much alike, and he wondered
who of them all could show these little waifs the
way to heaven.
</p>
<p>
For himself, he had gone through college honorably.
He was a moral young man, because a
certain fine, clean instinct and artistic sense forbade
any excesses. To be sure, he had read
Strauss and Renan after his Darwin and Spencer,
he had even dipped into the bitter fountains of
Schopenhauer. He had a jaunty idea that the
myths and miracles of the Bible were the fables
and legends of the nations in the earlier stages of
their development, quite outgrown in these later
days of exact philosophical reasoning.
</p>
<p>
But as he sat there, with these children’s eyes
fixed upon him with an intent life-and-death expression,
uttering a strong, inward soul cry that
reached his ears and would not be shut out, a certain
assurance came to him. These tender little
souls were waiting for the word that was to lead
them in the way of life everlasting. “Whoso
offendeth one of these little ones”—it was there
in letters of fire.
</p>
<p>
What but heaven could compensate them for
their dreary lives here! What but the love of
God infold them when father and mother had
failed. For surely they had not demanded any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
part in the struggle of life. Ah, if the dead rose
not again—what refinement of cruelty to send
human beings into the world to suffer like brutes,
having a higher consciousness to intensify it ten-fold,
and then be thrust into the terrible darkness
of nothingness. Even <em>he</em> was not willing to come
to a blank, purposeless end.
</p>
<p>
He had been sketching rapidly, but he saw the
little faces changing with an uncomprehended
dread. Dil’s sunshine was going out in sullen
despair. Yes, he <em>must</em> bear witness—for to-day,
for all time, for all human souls. In that moment
he believed. A rejoicing, reverent consciousness
was awakened within him; and the new
man had been born, the man who desired to learn
the way to heaven, even as these little children.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, there <em>is</em> a heaven.” He could feel the
tremulousness in his voice, yet the assurance
touched him with inexpressible sweetness, so new
and strange was it. “There is a God who cares
for us all, loves us all, and who has prepared a
beautiful land of rest where there is no pain nor
sorrow, where no one is sick or lonely or in any
want, where the Lord Jesus gathers the sorrowing
into his arms, and wipes away their tears, soothes
them with his own great love, which is sweeter
and tenderer than the best human love.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” cried Dil, as he paused, “are you jest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
certain sure? There was a little old lady who
came and sang once ’bout a beautiful country,
everlastin’ spring, an’ never with’rin’ flowers. I
didn’t get the hang of it all, but it left a sort of
sweetness in the air that you could almost feel,
you know. Don’t you b’lieve she knew ’bout the
truly heaven?”
</p>
<p>
Dil’s brown eyes were illumined again.
</p>
<p>
“Yes—that was heaven.” His grandmother
sang that old hymn. He would go up there and
learn it some day, and tell her that in the midst
of the great city he had borne witness to the faith.
The knowledge was so new and strange that it
filled him with great humility, made him a little
child like one of these.
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” cried Dil, with a long, restful sigh of satisfaction,
while every line of her face was transfigured,
“you must know, ’cause, you see, you’ve had
chances. You can read books and all. And now
I am quite sure—Bess an’ me,” placing her
hand lovingly over the little white one. “An’
mebbe you c’n tell us just how to go. And when
you come to the place, there’s a bridge or something
that people get over, and go up beyond the
sky—jest back of the blue sky,” with a certain
confident, happy emphasis in the narrow, but rapt,
vision.
</p>
<p>
“Couldn’t we start right away?” cried Bess
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
with eager hopefulness, her wan little face in a
glow of excitement. “What’s the good o’ goin’
back home? Me an’ Dil have talked it over an’
over. An’ there must be crowds an’ crowds goin’,—people
who are strong and well, an’ can run.
Why, I sh’d think they’d be in an awful hurry to
get there. An’ you said no one would be sick.
My head aches so when the babies cry, an’ my
poor back is so tired an’ sore. Oh, if I had two
good legs, so Dil wouldn’t have to push me an’ lift
me out an’ in! O Dil, do let’s go!”
</p>
<p>
She was trembling with excitement, and her
eyes were a luminous glow.
</p>
<p>
What could John Travis say to these eager
pilgrims? He did not remember that he had
ever known any one in a hurry to get to heaven.
How strange it was! And how could he explain
this great mystery of which he knew so little,—the
walk that was by faith, not sight?
</p>
<p>
“You said you had been to the Mission School,”
catching at that straw eagerly. “Did they not
tell you—teach you”—and he paused in confusion.
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t been much. Mammy don’t b’lieve in
thim. An’ I think they don’t know. One tells
you one thing, an’ the nex’ one another. One
woman said the sky was all stars through an’
through, an’ heaven was jest round you, an’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
where you lived. Well, if it’s Barker’s Court,”
and she made a strange, impressive pause, “’tain’t
much like the place the woman set out for.”
</p>
<p>
“She left the City of Destruction. Her name
was Christiana.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes!” kindling anew with awakened memory.
“Well, that’s Barker’s Court. There’s
fightin’, an’ swearin’, an’ gettin’ drunk, an’ bein’
’rested. Poor Bess hears ’em in the night when
she can’t sleep. An’ the woman went away, an’
took her children. But mammy wouldn’t go, an’
we’ll have to start by our two selves. O mister!
do you know anything ’bout prayin’? The teacher
told me how, an’ I prayed ’bout Bess’s poor legs,
an’ that mother’d let rum alone, an’ not go off into
tantrums the way pop uster. An’ it didn’t do a
bit o’ good.”
</p>
<p>
She looked up so perplexed. This was not scientific
or philosophical ignorance,—he could find
arguments to combat that; it was not unwillingness
to try, but the utter innocent ignorance,
with the boundary of certain literal experiences.
But how could he explain? From the depths of
his heart he cried for wisdom.
</p>
<p>
“It is a long journey, and the summer is almost
gone,” he said, after some consideration. “The
cold weather will be here presently, and you are
both so little; suppose you wait until next spring?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
I will find you that book about Christiana, and you
can learn a good many things—and be getting
ready—”
</p>
<p>
He knew he was paltering with a miserable
subterfuge; but, oh! what could he say? Surely,
ere violets bloomed again and buttercups were
golden, Bess would have solved the great mystery.
Ah, to think of her as well and rejoicing
in heaven! It moved all one’s heart in gratitude.
</p>
<p>
Both children looked pitifully disappointed.
Bess was first to recover. The tears shone in
her eyes as she said,—
</p>
<p>
“Well, le’s wait. My clo’es is most worn out,
an’ the cold pinches me up so, Dil, you know.
An’ it’ll be nice to find how Christiana went.
How’ll we get the book?”
</p>
<p>
“I will bring it to you,” he promised.
</p>
<p>
“An’ will there be wild roses in heaven?” Bess
fingered the poor faded buds as if her conscience
suddenly smote her.
</p>
<p>
“All beautiful things; and they will not wither
in that divine air.”
</p>
<p>
She pressed them against her cheek with a
touch so tender he could have blessed her for it.
And there came the other vision of the soft white
fingers that had torn them so ruthlessly in her
anger; of the hot, passionate words! Would she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
forgive if he went to her, or would she tread his
olive branch in the dust?
</p>
<p>
“Tell me something about yourselves;” and he
roused from his dream abruptly. “Where is your
father?”
</p>
<p>
“’Twas him that hurted Bess’s legs, an’ he got
jugged for it. He beat mammy dreadful—he
uster when he had the drink in him. An’ now
mammy’s goin’ the same way. That’s why I’d like
to take Bess somewhere—”
</p>
<p>
“Are there just you two?”
</p>
<p>
“There’s Owen an’ Dan. They’re little chaps,
but they’d get along. Boys soon get big enough
to strike back. An’ some one else ’ud have to
look out for the babies.”
</p>
<p>
“Babies! How many?” in amaze.
</p>
<p>
“I keep thim when their mothers go to work.
Sometimes they’re cross, and it’s dreadful for poor
Bess.”
</p>
<p>
“And your mother allows you to do that?”
</p>
<p>
“She’s got ter!” cried Bess, her smouldering
indignation breaking out. “An’ keep the house.
An’ when there’s only two or three mother swears
she’ll send Dil to the shop to work. So we’d
rather have thim, for it would be dreadful for me
to be without Dil, don’t you see?”
</p>
<p>
Yes, he saw, and his heart ached. He had
a vague idea of some of the comfortable homes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
but to be without Dil! “Did his mother and
sisters ever meet with any such lives, and such
tender devotion?” he wondered. It was enough
to break one’s heart. It almost broke his to think
he could not rescue them. The picturesque aspects
of poverty had appealed to him in the street-gamins
and ragged old men who besieged him for
“tin cints fer a night’s lodgin’,” that he knew
would be spent for whiskey in the nearest saloon;
but of the actual lives of the very poor he had but
the vaguest idea.
</p>
<p>
“And your mother?” he ventured, dreading the
reply.
</p>
<p>
“She goes out washin’. ’Tisn’t so very bad,
you see,” returned Dil, with a certain something
akin to pride. “Beggin’s worse.”
</p>
<p>
He had finished the sketches,—there were
several of them,—and he began to gather up his
pencils.
</p>
<p>
“Now that the work is done, we must have a
picnic,” he said cheerfully. “I’ll find a fruit-stand
somewhere. Keep right here until I return.”
</p>
<p>
The children gazed at each other in a sort of
speechless wonder. There were no words to express
the strange joy that filled each heart. Their
eyes followed him in and out, and even when
he was lost to sight their faith remained perfect.
Then they looked at each other, still in amazement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s better’n Cunny Island,” said Bess. “I’ve
wisht we could go sometime when mother’s
startin’ out. But if she’d been good an’ tooken
us, we wouldn’t a’ seen <em>him</em>. But I’m kinder
sorry not to start right away, after all. Only
there’s the cold, an’ I ain’t got no clo’es. Mebbe
he knows best. An’ he’s so nice.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s curis,” Dil said after a long pause. “I
wisht I could read quick an’ had some learnin’.
There’s so many things to know. There’s so
many people in the world, an’ some of thim have
such nice things, an’ can go to places—”
</p>
<p>
“Their folks don’t drink rum, mebbe,” returned
the little one sententiously.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t s’pose you can get out of it ’cept by
goin’ to heaven. But then, why—mebbe the
others what’s havin’ good times don’t care to go.
Mebbe he won’t,” drearily.
</p>
<p>
He soon returned with a bag of fruit. Such
pears, such peaches, and bananas! And when he
took out his silver fruit-knife, pared them, and
made little plates out of paper, their wonder was
beyond any words.
</p>
<p>
Dil eyed hers askance. She was so used to
saving the best.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, do eat it,” cried Bess. “You never tasted
anything like it! O mister, please tell her to.
She’s alwers keepin’ things for me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
</p>
<p>
“There will be plenty for you to take home. I
must find you some flowers too. And this evening
I am going to start on a journey—to be away
several weeks. I’m sorry to lose sight of you,
and I want to know how to find Barker’s Court.
When I come back—would your mother mind
your posing for me, do you think?”
</p>
<p>
“Posing?” Dil looked frightened.
</p>
<p>
“Just what you did this afternoon. Being put
in a picture.”
</p>
<p>
It had suddenly come into his mind that he
could lighten Dil’s burthen that way. He wanted
to keep track of them.
</p>
<p>
“And what do you do with the pictures?”
</p>
<p>
“Sell them”—and he smiled.
</p>
<p>
“You couldn’t sell me; I’m not pritty enough,”
she said, with the utter absence of all personal
vanity, and a latent sense of amusement.
</p>
<p>
“When I come back we will talk about it.
And I will bring you the book. You will learn
more than I can tell you. I used to read it when
I was a boy. And then we will talk about—going
to heaven.”
</p>
<p>
He colored a little, and his heart beat with a
new and unwonted emotion.
</p>
<p>
“You’re quite sure we can go nex’ spring?”
queried Bess. “Do many people live there?”
</p>
<p>
“The Lord Jesus Christ and all his angels,” he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
answered reverently. “And the saints who have
been redeemed, little children, and a multitude no
man can number.”
</p>
<p>
A perplexing frown settled between Dil’s eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Seems as if I couldn’t never get the thing
straight ’bout—’bout Jesus Christ,” and a flush
wavered over her face. “When the people in the
court get drunk and fight, they swear ’bout him.
If he jest gives people strength to beat and bang
each other, how can he help ’em to be good?
Maybe there’s more than one. An’ why don’t
the one who lives in the beautiful heaven have a
different name. I ast the Mission teacher once,
an’ she said I was a wicked girl. Mammy said
there wasn’t any God at all. How do <em>you</em>
know?”
</p>
<p>
There was a brave, eager innocence in her eyes,
and a curious urgency as well.
</p>
<p>
“’Cause,” she subjoined, “if God lives in
heaven and keeps it for people, if there wasn’t any
God, there couldn’t be any heaven. Some folks in
the court have the Virgin Mary, but I never see
God.”
</p>
<p>
There was no irreverence in her tone, but a perplexed
wonder. And John Travis was helpless
before it. How did the missionaries who went to
the heathen ever make them understand? They
had their idols of wood and stone, and had prayed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
to them; but this child had no God, not even an
idol, though she loved Bess with every fibre of
her being.
</p>
<p>
And he had almost said in his heart, “There is
no God.” A first great cause, an atom rushing
blindly about the darkness for another atom, a
protoplasm, a long series of evolutions—how
complacent he had been about it all! Could he
teach these children science? He had heard
the talk of the slums occasionally, blood-curdling
oaths, threats, wishes, curses hurled at one another.
These two little girls lived in it. Could
any one enlighten them, unless they were taken
to a new, clean world? Yet their souls seemed
scarcely soiled by the contact, their faces bore the
impress of purity.
</p>
<p>
Was it thus when the Lord came in the flesh,
when the wickedness of the world was very great,
its hopelessness well nigh fatal? He found many
ignorant souls; but they learned of him and believed,
and went forth to convert the world. Was
it so much more wicked now?
</p>
<p>
“Let me tell you about the true Jesus,” he
said in a soft, low tone, almost afraid to bear witness,
he was so ignorant himself. “Long ago,
when people were full of sorrow and suffering, and
had forgotten how to be good to each other, God,
who lived in this beautiful heaven, sent his Son
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
down to teach them. He came and lived among
them and helped them. Why, my little Dil, it’s
just like your caring for Bess. She can never do
anything to pay you back. She cannot sweep the
house, nor tend the babies, nor sew, nor earn
money. But you do it because you love her, and
you only want love in return. She gives it to
you.”
</p>
<p>
Dil stared stupidly. “I don’t want her to do
nothin’,” she said, with a quivering lip.
</p>
<p>
“But you want her to love you.”
</p>
<p>
“How could I help it?” cried Bess.
</p>
<p>
“No, you couldn’t. And when the Lord found
people ill and lame and blind, he cured them—”
</p>
<p>
“O mister!” interrupted Bess, with her face
in a glow of wonderful light, “do you s’pose he
could have cured my poor hurted little legs so’s I
could walk on ’em agen?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, my child. He would have taken you
in his arms and laid his hand on you, and you
would have been strong and well.”
</p>
<p>
“And where is he now?” she asked eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“He went back to heaven—to his Father.”
Ah, how could he explain to their limited understanding
the sacrifice that had redeemed the
world. He began to realize that faith for one’s
self was easier than giving a reason for one’s faith.
“He told people how to be kind and tender and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>
loving, and to care for those in pain and sickness.
He begged them to do it because he had loved
them. That was all he wanted back. But there
were ungrateful people, and those who were eager
to fight and destroy each other, and they would
not listen to him. But when he went away he left
others, teachers, and they go on telling people—”
</p>
<p>
How could he make it simple enough for their
comprehension? He was in despair.
</p>
<p>
“Then he called those together who loved him
and were willing to be good and kind, and said to
them, ‘In my Father’s house are many mansions—I
go to prepare a place that you may be with
me’—”
</p>
<p>
“And that’s heaven,” interrupted Bess, her
eyes shining and her lips pink and quivering. “O
Dil! that’s where we are to go. I can’t hardly
wait till spring. An’ soon’s we get there, I’ll ast
him to cure my poor little legs poppy hurted when
he threw me ’gainst the wall. Oh, are you sure,
sure he will, so I can run about agen? Seems
jes’ too good to happen.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I am sure. He took little children in
his arms and blessed them when they crowded
around him so that people would have driven
them away. And he said, ‘I have a heaven for all
those who suffer, all those whose parents beat or
maim or starve them. I will take them to my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
beautiful home, and they shall never suffer any
more. They shall roam in lovely gardens and
gather flowers, and sing and love and obey me,
and be happy.’”
</p>
<p>
“O Dil, <em>will</em> you mind if I love this Lord Jesus?
For he is so good I can’t help it. I shall always
love <em>you</em> best. I will tell him how it was—that
you loved me when there wasn’t any one else,
and mammy wanted me to die ’cause I was so
much trouble. An’, Dil, don’t you b’lieve he will
say that was jest the kind of love he preached
about, and ’cause you did it you must have a place
right by me?”
</p>
<p>
The tears came to John Travis’s eyes. He
wondered if the Master had ever been rewarded
with a more exquisite joy.
</p>
<p>
Dil squeezed her hand.
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” cried Bess, “when we start to go to
heaven in the spring, won’t you go along? We’d
like to have you so. Don’t they have grown-up
men in heaven? You’re so nice an’ clean an’
different from most folks, I sh’d think you’d like
to go.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I will,” in the tone of one who gives a
sacred promise. When he came to think of it,
very few people had asked him to go to heaven.
</p>
<p>
“Seems too good to be true,” said Dil sententiously.
“Good things mos’ly ain’t true. An’ it
all seems so strange—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll talk it over while we are going to
heaven,” he said with grave sweetness, glancing
at his watch and amazed at the lateness. “I will
bring you Christiana, and when you have read
that I can explain many things to you. I shall
have to go now. Tell me how to find Barker’s
Court when I come back.”
</p>
<p>
“You won’t like it,” Dil exclaimed sharply.
“It’s dirty an’ horrid, full of women washing
clo’es, an’ drunken people, an’ swearin’. Oh, let
me bring Bess over here. And the picture—”
</p>
<p>
“You shall have that. But I can’t tell just
when I shall be able to come. Never fear but
I’ll find you. Here is something because you and
Bess posed.”
</p>
<p>
It was a five-dollar note. Dil drew back in
dismay.
</p>
<p>
“O mister, I couldn’t take it. I’m afeard some
one’d think I stole it—so much money!”
</p>
<p>
He changed the bill into smaller ones. Then
he slipped it into the bag of fruit.
</p>
<p>
“This is Bess’s bank,” he said, with a friendly,
trusty smile. “When she wants any delicacies,
you must spend the money for them. It is Bess’s
secret, and you must not tell any one.”
</p>
<p>
He thrust the bag at the foot of the shabby
carriage, and then pressed both hands.
</p>
<p>
“You’re so lovely, so splendid,” sighed Bess.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
He picked up three withered buds—had some
hands very dear to him held them?
</p>
<p>
“Good-by. I shall find Barker’s Court and you,
never fear.” Then he plunged into the crowd, not
daring to look back. What a week it had been,
beginning with sorrow and loss, and—had he
found the Master? Had these strange, brave
little heathens, who knew not God, opened his
eyes and his heart to that better way?
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>IV—THE DELIGHTS OF WEALTH</h2>
<p>
The children sat there in a maze of bewilderment.
They knew nothing of fairy godmothers,
or Santa Claus, or the dainty myths of childhood.
Four years Bess had been in prison, twice four
years Dilsey Quinn had been a bound slave. Not
that Mrs. Quinn had been hard above all mothers.
In the next house there were two little girls who
sat and sewed from daylight to dark, and had no
Saturday even, the age of Owen and Bess. Barker’s
Court was an industrious place for children,
at least. If they could have played when the
men were sleeping off orgies, or the women gossiping,
they would have had many a respite from
toil.
</p>
<p>
This wonderful thing that had befallen Bess
and Dil was so beyond any event that had ever
happened before, and their imaginations were so
limited, they could never have dreamed such a
romance. John Travis had disappeared in the
throng. But there was the bag of fruit, and the
sweet knowledge that nothing could take away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
</p>
<p>
The roar of vehicles had grown less. Pedestrians
were thinning out, for supper-time was
drawing nigh. The shadows were lengthening;
the wind had a certain grateful coolness. Still
they sat as in a trance. The “cop” had received
a “tip” to keep a kindly watch over them, but
he would have done it without any reward.
</p>
<p>
“Dil!” The soft voice broke the hush, for it
was as if they two were alone in the crowd.
</p>
<p>
The little fingers closed over the firm brown
ones. They looked at each other for some moments
with grave, wondering eyes. Then Dil
rose soberly, settled Bess anew, and pushed the
wagon along. The paper bag lay in plain sight,
but no one molested it.
</p>
<p>
Dil began to come back to her narrow, practical
world. Heaven, as John Travis had put it, was
something for Bess rather than herself. It was
too great a feast to sit down to all at once. And
Dil was not much used to feasting, even playing
at it with bits of broken crockery and make-believes,
as so many children do. They left the
enchanted country behind them, and returned to
more familiar sights and sounds. Still, the delicious
fragrance of the pears, the flavor of the
peaches, the sweetness of the candy, was so
much beyond the treats over on the East Side.
</p>
<p>
“Bess,” she said, stopping at a show window
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
on the avenue, “jes’ look at the caps an’ things.
Do you s’pose it’s real money in the bag? For
it’s yours, an’ you do need a new cap. That old
one’ll hardly hold together. If some one doesn’t
give mammy a pile of things pritty soon, you’ll
have to go naked.”
</p>
<p>
They both laughed. “O Dil! wasn’t it splendid?”
and Bess turned her head around, as if she
might still see their beneficent friend.
</p>
<p>
“Let me feel in my bank,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Dil handed her the bag, full of fruity fragrance.
She drew out a bill with a fearful little gesture.
</p>
<p>
“They’re good, all of ’em,” she said reassuringly.
“He wouldn’t give us bad money to get
us into trouble. An’ we never have any real
money to spend.”
</p>
<p>
Still Dil eyed the bill doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“An’ flannils, an’ O Dil, couldn’t you buy <em>one</em>
new dress? I’d like to have a spandy new one
for onct.”
</p>
<p>
“I s’pose mother wouldn’t know when onct it
was washed. An’ I might crumple down the
bows on the cap. O Bess, you’d look so sweet!
I wisht you’d had a new cap to-day. He said
’twas your money. An’ I was most afear’d it was
like thim things Patsey told about, when you
raised the han’kercher they wasn’t there!”
</p>
<p>
“But they’re here.” She laughed with soft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
exultation. “Le’s go in, Dil. I never went shoppin’
in my life! You could hide the things away
from mammy. There’d be no use givin’ it to her.
She’s got enough for gin an’ to go to Cunny
Island an’ MacBride’s. But jinky! wouldn’t she
crack our skulls if she <em>did</em> know it. O Dil, let’s
never, <em>never</em> tell.”
</p>
<p>
“She couldn’t make me tell if she killed me.”
</p>
<p>
“Le’s go in. Can you carry me?”
</p>
<p>
She drew the wagon up by the corner of the
show-window, and, taking Bess in her arms, entered
the store and seated her on a stool, standing
so she could brace the weak little back. Of the
few dreams that had found lodgment in Dil’s
prosaic brain, was this of indulging her motherly,
womanly instinct, shopping for Bess. She felt
dazed to have it come true. Her face flushed,
her breath came irregularly, her heart beat with
a delicious, half-guilty pleasure.
</p>
<p>
There was no one else in the store. A pale,
tired, but kindly-looking woman came to wait on
her. Dil tried on caps with laces and ribbons,
and Bess looked so angelic it broke her heart to
take them off. But the plain ones were less
likely to betray them. Then they looked at
dresses and the coveted “flannils,” and one nice
soft petticoat, and oh, some new stockings.
</p>
<p>
A shrewd little shopper was Dil. She counted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
up every purchase, and laid aside the sum, really
surprised at her bargains and the amount she had
left. The attendant was very sympathetic, and
inquired what had befallen Bess. Dil said she
had been hurted by a bad fall, that her mother
was ’most always out to work, and that they hadn’t
any father. She was afraid her mother might be
washing somewhere, and hear the story, if she
was too explicit.
</p>
<p>
“Le’s buy a han’kercher for Patsey,” suggested
Bess, her pale face in a glow.
</p>
<p>
They chose one with a pink border, thinking
of the wild roses that had brought such great
good luck.
</p>
<p>
“And here is a blue belt ribbon for the little
girl,” said the lady. “It’s been in the window,
and has two faded places, but you can tie them in
the bow.”
</p>
<p>
Dil had been struggling between economy and
a belt ribbon. She raised her brown eyes so full
of delight that words were hardly needed.
</p>
<p>
They packed up their goods and departed.
Bess wore her cap, and held up her head like a
real lady. I doubt if there were two happier
children in the whole city.
</p>
<p>
Dusk was beginning to fall; but all the stores
were in a glow, and now people were coming out
again after supper. They seldom stayed this late,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
but to-night they were quite safe. And oh, how
splendid it all was! the happiness of a lifetime.
</p>
<p>
Bess kept turning partly round and talking out
her delight. Pain and weariness were forgotten.
They laughed in sheer gladness. If John Travis
could have seen them, he would have said he had
never in his life made such an investment of five
dollars.
</p>
<p>
“And we’ve only spent a little over two. Oh,
what a lot of things you can buy when you have
some money! An’, Dil, we’ll put away a good
bit, so’s when there ain’t many babies mother
won’t bang you. Oh, she’d kill us both dead an’
take the money if she knew, wouldn’t she?”
</p>
<p>
“She would that,” subjoined Dil grimly.
</p>
<p>
Poor Dil had been banged pretty severely in
her short day. Last spring Mrs. Quinn had been
complained of, as the “banging” had been so
severe that Dil had fainted, and had to keep her
bed several days.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I wisht we wasn’t ever going home,”
sighed Bess. “If I had two good legs we’d run
away like that Mullin girl. An’ now that I’ve got
some clo’es, I’m sorry we can’t go right off. Nex’
spring—how many months, Dil?”
</p>
<p>
August was almost ended. Seven long, weary
months at the best.
</p>
<p>
“There’s Thanksgivin’ an’ Christmas, an’—an’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
St. Patrick’s; that’s in March, I know. An’ after
that it gen’ally comes warm. Oh, it seems as if
I couldn’t wait! But the man will come with
Christiana, an’ then we’ll find how to go without
gettin’ lost or makin’ a mistake. Ain’t it queer?
I should think everybody’d want to go.”
</p>
<p>
The big eyes were full of wonder.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you see the people who have money an’
things an’ flowers an’ journeys an’ live in grand
houses don’t need to be in a hurry. ’Tain’t of
so much account to them. An’ I guess people
haven’t got the straight of it, someway.”
</p>
<p>
Poor Dil! She wasn’t very straight in her own
mind. If God could give people so much, why
didn’t he do it now? Or if they had to go to
heaven for it, why wasn’t it made plain, and you
could be let to start whenever you desired?
</p>
<p>
Bess’s confidence gave her a curiously apprehensive
feeling. Suppose there wasn’t any heaven?
The mystery was incomprehensible.
</p>
<p>
It was late when they reached home. Oh, the
sickening heat and smells! But at this hour on
Saturday night the court was comparatively quiet.
The revelry began later.
</p>
<p>
Dan sat on the stoop crying. He had been in
a fight, and the under dog at that, and had one
black eye, and his jacket torn to ribbons.
</p>
<p>
“An’ mother’ll wollop me for the jacket,” he
whimpered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
</p>
<p>
“Come an’ have yer eye tied up with cold
water. I did a bit of work this afternoon, an’
got some goodies, an’ you shall have some. Oh,
it’s pritty bad, Dan. Take my penny an’ go buy
an oyster,—that’ll help get the black out.”
</p>
<p>
Dan was mightily tempted to spend the penny
otherwise, but the thought of the goodies restrained
him. Dil took Bess and the “treasures”
up-stairs, and laid her gently on the old lounge.
She had everything put away when Dan returned,
so she washed his face and bound up his eye.
</p>
<p>
He ceased sniffling, and cried, “O golly!” at
the sight of two luscious bananas. “Dil, ye wor
in luck! I didn’t even see a chance to snivy on
an apple. Store folks is mighty s’picious, watchin’
out.”
</p>
<p>
“O Dan! It’s wicked to steal!”
</p>
<p>
“None o’ yer gals’ gaff!” said Dan with his
mouth full. “Snivyin’ somethin’ ter eat ain’t no
stealin’. An’ I’m hungry as an elefunt.”
</p>
<p>
Dil fixed him some supper, and he devoured
it with the apparent capacity of the elephant.
Then, as he was very tired and used up, he tumbled
on his straw pallet in his mother’s room,
and in five minutes was asleep.
</p>
<p>
Now the young conspirators had to consider
about a hiding-place for their unaccustomed treasures.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you,” and Bess laughed shrewdly,
“we’ll make a bank under the cushion of the
wagon.” At the risk of smothering Dan, they
had shut his door. “Mother wouldn’t dast to
tumble me out, and no one <em>knows</em>. An’ we’ll
call it somethin’ else. We’ll never say m——”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.” Dil put it in the paper bag, and then
she made the night bed on top of it. What a
fortune it was! They glanced furtively at each
other, as if questioning their right to it.
</p>
<p>
“Mammy seldom <em>does</em> look round,” said Dil;
“an’ I’ll clear the room up on Fridays, I sometimes
do. An’ I’ll tell her I made the dress, if
she spies it out. No, that would be a lie, an’
tellin’ lies roughs you up inside, though sometimes
it’s better than bein’ banged. Bess, dear,
I wish it was all true ’bout heaven.”
</p>
<p>
“It is true, I feel it all over me.”
</p>
<p>
Poor Dil sighed softly. She wasn’t so sure.
</p>
<p>
Then she bathed Bess, and threw away the
ragged garments. Bess was tired, but bright and
happy. They stowed away their purchases, and
were all settled when Owen came in. No one
would have guessed the rare holiday.
</p>
<p>
Barker’s Court was beginning its weekly orgy—singing,
swearing, dancing, fighting, and fortunate
if there was not an arrest or two. But Dil
was so tired that she slept through it all, forgetting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
about the money, and not even haunted by
dreams.
</p>
<p>
It was past midnight when Mrs. Quinn returned,
to find everything still within. She tumbled
across her bed, and slept the sleep of a
drunken woman until Sunday noon.
</p>
<p>
Dil looked after the breakfast. Dan’s eye was
much improved. Out of an old bundle she found
a jacket a size or two beyond him, but the children
of the slums are not critical. The boys
went out to roam the streets. Patsey sidled in
with a knowing wink towards Mrs. Quinn’s
chamber door. It was nearly always safe on
Sunday morning. He had a handful of flowers.
</p>
<p>
They gave him his “hankercher.” But somehow
they couldn’t tell him of their adventure.
</p>
<p>
“But yous oughtn’t ’er spend yer tin on me,”
he said with awkward gratefulness. “Yous don’t
have much look fer scrapin’ it up.”
</p>
<p>
“But you’re alwers so good to us,” returned
Bess, in her sweet, plaintive tone.
</p>
<p>
“An’ when yous want a nickel or two, let me
know,” he said with manly tenderness.
</p>
<p>
Dil made her mother a cup of strong coffee,
and brushed out her long black hair, still handsome
enough for a woman of fashion to envy.
She had made a big Irish stew for dinner, and
when the house was cleared up, she had leave to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>
take Bess out. But they did not go to the square
to-day. They rambled up and down some of the
nicer streets, where the houses were closed and
the people away, and speculated about the journey
to heaven in the spring. Alas! There were
hundreds more who did not even know there was
a heaven, or for what the church bells rang, or
why Sunday came.
</p>
<p>
The week was melting hot. One of the babies
had a very sick day, and died that night. Several
others in the court died, but the summer was always
hard on babies. Mrs. Quinn had a day off,
and went up to Glen Island. Children and babies
were taken away for a day or a week; but Dil was
too busy, and it would have been no pleasure for
Bess to go without her. But some way they were
overlooked.
</p>
<p>
The heat kept up well in September. People
came home from the country, and Mrs. Quinn’s
business was brisk enough. The boys were sent
to school; but Owen often played “hookey,” and
was getting quite unmanageable, in fact, a neighborhood
terror.
</p>
<p>
It seemed strange indeed that Bess could live
under such circumstances. But Dil’s love and
care were marvellous. She kept the child exquisitely
clean; she even indulged in a bottle of
refreshing cologne, and some luxuries, for which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
they blessed John Travis. Three times they had
been over to the square. They counted up the
weeks; they believed with all possible faith at
first, then Dil weakened unconsciously. She
used to get so tired herself in these days. Her
mother was very captious, and the babies fell
off. Some days Dil put in two nickels out of
her precious fund. Bess insisted upon it.
</p>
<p>
Dilsey Quinn ran out of an errand now and
then. She was too busy ever to loiter, and every
moment away from Bess was torture. So, although
they lived in a crowd, they might as well
have been on a desert island, as far as companionship
went.
</p>
<p>
And now they saw less of Patsey, to their sorrow.
He had saved up a little money, and borrowed
some from a good friend, and bought a
chair, and set himself up in business. Not a
mere common little “kit,” mind you. But it
was way down town, and he had new lodgings
to be “handy.”
</p>
<p>
The last of September the weather, that had
been lovely, changed. There was a long, cold
storm, and blustering winds that would have done
credit to March. The “flannils,” that had been
such a luxury, were too thin, and Dil spent almost
her last penny for some others. No one had ever
found out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
</p>
<p>
How often they looked wistfully at each other,
and asked a wordless question. But John Travis
had not found them, had not come. Six weeks
since that blissful Saturday!
</p>
<p>
It had been a very hard day for Dil; and heaven
seemed far off, as it does to many of us in times
of trouble. The morning was lowering and chilly.
Dil had overslept, and her mother’s morning cup
of coffee was not to her taste. She had given her
a box on the ear, I was about to say; but her
mother’s hand covered the whole side of her head,
and filled it with a rush as of many waters, blinding
her eyes so that all looked dark about her.
Then Mrs. Kenny’s little Mamie cried for her
mother, and would not be pacified. Mrs. Kenny
was a young and deserted wife who worked in a
coat-shop, and Mamie was a Saturday boarder as
well. Dil made the boys’ breakfast with the baby
in her arms, and managed to get Bess’s bread and
milk, but had hardly a moment to devote to her.
Only one more baby came in.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn suddenly reappeared. Mrs. Watson
had been called away by the illness of her mother,
and the washing was to go over to the next
week.
</p>
<p>
“An’ she’ll want two days’ work done in one,
an’ no more pay. An’ they don’t mind about <em>your</em>
lost day! How’s a woman to live with a great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
raft of young ones to support, I’d like to know?
An’ it’s hard times we hear about a’ready. Goodness
knows what I’ll do. An’ you lazy trollop!
you haven’t your dishes washed yet! An’ only
two babies! Yer’ not worth yer salt!”
</p>
<p>
“Mamie has cried all the time—”
</p>
<p>
“Shet yer head! Not a word of impidence out
of you, or I’ll crack yer skull! An’ I know—yer’ve
been foolin’ over that wretched little brat
in there! I’m a fool fer not sindin’ her up to th’
Island hospital. Fine work they’d have with
her! She’d get nussed.”
</p>
<p>
Dil uttered a cry of terror.
</p>
<p>
Her mother caught her by the shoulder, and
banged her head sharp against the wall, until no
telescope was needed for her to see stars, even in
the day time. They swirled around like balls of
fire, and Dil staggered to a chair, looking so
ghastly that her mother was startled.
</p>
<p>
Both babies set up a howl.
</p>
<p>
“Drat the brats!” she cried, shaking her fist
at them. “If there can’t be more than two, you’ll
march off to a shop, Dilsey Quinn; an’ if you don’t
earn your bread, you won’t get it, that’s all! As
fer you, ye little weasened-face, broken-backed
thing, cumberin’ the ground—”
</p>
<p>
Bess seemed to shrink into nothing. Mrs.
Quinn had taken her glass of gin too early in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
day. What would have happened next—but a
rap on the door averted it.
</p>
<p>
“O Mrs. Quinn!” cried Mrs. Malone, “I saw
ye comin’ back, an’ have ye no work the day?”
</p>
<p>
“My folks went off. If I’d known last night”—Mrs.
Quinn picked up one baby to hush it.
</p>
<p>
“Well, now, Ann come in a moment ago to
hunt up a la’ndress. The big folks where she
lives have been lift in the lurch with ivry blissid
thing sprinkled down. An’ can ye go an’ iron fer
’em? It’s a foine place. Two days in a week,
an’ good pay. But the la’ndress has grown that
sassy they had a reg’lar shindy this mornin’. If
ye’ll jist go for wanst, they’ll all be moighty glad,
for it’s a fine ironer ye are, Mrs. Quinn.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go back wid Ann.” Mrs. Quinn dropped
the baby, and resumed her hood and shawl.
</p>
<p>
Bess shivered, and stretched out her arms to
Dil as soon as the door closed.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, what should we have done if she had stayed
at home! She looked at me so dreadful. And
she would have shaked the very life out of me if
she had taken hold of me. O Dil, don’t let her
send me away!”
</p>
<p>
“If she should—if she did—I’d—I’d kill
her!” and a fierce, desperate look came in the
brown eyes. “O Bess dear, don’t cry so, don’t
cry.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
</p>
<p>
“O Dil,” sobbed the child, “then you’d be
jugged like daddy, but you wouldn’t kill her—you
couldn’t, she’s so much bigger an’ stronger.”
</p>
<p>
“But I’d fight awful! And I wouldn’t stay.
I’d run away, if I had to drown myself.”
</p>
<p>
“They cut people up in hospitals”—and there
was an awesome sound in the frightened voice.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t, dear, don’t;” and the pleading was
that of agony. She held Bess close—all her
life was centred in this poor, maimed body. The
babies might cry, the world might cease to be,
but nothing should part them.
</p>
<p>
“She’ll be cross because there ain’t more babies.
And to-day she knows. But the bank’s
most all out. O Dil, s’pose something happened
to—to him!”
</p>
<p>
They looked at each other in a pathetic fashion
through their tears, each bearing the other’s sorrow,
though they knew nothing of the divine
injunction. Dil had fought silent battles with
herself for faith in John Travis, but Bess had
never wavered until now.
</p>
<p>
“It was so beautiful—that afternoon, an’ the
talkin’. I’ve thought so often ’bout his Lord
Jesus, who could make my poor little legs well,
an’, Dil, somehow they keep shrinken’ away. An’
the lovely fruit an’ things! An’ all that money!
O Dil, we know now how rich folks feel, only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
they’re rich all their lives, and we was rich jest
that little while. But it was splendid! Rich
folks oughter be happy every minnit, an’—an’
good. ’Twould be so easy when you lived in a
big, beautiful house, an’ had flowers an’ nice things
to eat an’ to wear, an’ a kerrige to ride in—”
</p>
<p>
She stopped exhausted, but her eyes glowed
with the vision, and a rapture illumined her wan
face. Ah, Bess, one poor, forlorn creature, born
in the brain of the finest genius of his time, made
the same pathetic outcry in her pitiful plight,
brought about by her own ill-doing. And you
both touched the boundary of a broad truth.
</p>
<p>
Dil gave a long, quivering breath, and it seemed
as if her arms could never unclose again, so tight
and fast did they hold their treasure.
</p>
<p>
“I’m <em>most</em> sure he’ll come.” Bess made a
strenuous effort to keep the doubt out of her
tone. “He was ter bring the book, you know,
and the picture; an’ he didn’t look ’s though he
was one of the forgettin’ kind. There’s somethin’—I
can’t quite make it out; but Dil, when
things is all still, most towards mornin’, seems <em>if</em>
I could hear him talk. Only—it’s so long to
spring. I’m most sorry we didn’t start that day.
Why, we might have been to heaven before real
cold weather. I’m so tired. Dil, dear, lay me
down on the lounge, won’t you? It’ll rest me a
bit.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
She put her down softly, and tucked the faded
quilt about her. Mamie had fallen asleep on the
floor, and she laid her on her own little pallet.
The other baby had found a dropped-out knot in
the floor, and was trying to put his crust of bread
down through it.
</p>
<p>
Dil washed her dishes and tidied up the house.
The clothes from the floor above swung on the
pulley-line, and helped to shut out even the chilly
gray light. Then there was dinner to get for the
boys, who went to school quite steadily. Dan
wasn’t so bad, though; and Owen had been threatened
with the reform-school, “where you had to
sweep floors and sew on a machine like a gal!”
That did not look so inviting as liberty.
</p>
<p>
What would happen to-night when her mother
came home? Would she, could she, send Bess
away?
</p>
<p>
“’Tain’t no use to pray,” she thought despairingly
within her much-tried soul. “I uster pray
about Bess’s poor little legs, an’ they never
mended any. An’ mebbe he thought we’d be a
bother, an’ he’d rather go to heaven alone.”
</p>
<p>
What had become of John Travis?
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>V—A SONG IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>
In the twenty-four years of John Travis’s life
he had not done much but please himself. There
was never any special pinch in the Travis household,
any choice of two things, with the other to
be given up entirely. His father was an easy-going
man, his mother an amiable society woman,
proud, of course, of her good birth. As I said
before, excesses were not to John’s taste. He
didn’t look like a fastidious young fellow, but the
Travises were clean, wholesome people. Perhaps
this was where their good blood really showed
itself.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Travis had a little leaning toward the law
for his son; the young fellow fancied he had a little
leaning toward medicine. He dallied somewhat
with both; he wrote a few pretty society
verses; he etched very successfully, and he painted
a few pictures, which roused an art ambition
within him. He fell in love with a sweet girl in
the winter, and in the late summer they had quarrelled
and gone separate ways.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
</p>
<p>
There had been another factor in his life,—his
cousin, Austin Travis, some twelve years older
than himself, his father’s eldest brother’s only
child, and the eldest grandson. Travis farm had
been his early home; and there John, the little
boy, had fallen in love with the big boy.
</p>
<p>
Austin was one of the charming society men
that women delight in. Every winter girls tried
their best for him; and John was made much of
on his account, for they were almost inseparable.
It was Austin who soothed his uncle’s disappointment
in the law business. It was Austin who
compelled the rather dilatory young fellow to
paint in earnest.
</p>
<p>
Austin had planned a September tour. They
would spend a few days with grandmother, and
then go to the Adirondacks. He knew a camping-out
party of artists and designers that it would
be an advantage for John to meet.
</p>
<p>
John had packed his traps and sent them down
to the boat, that was to go out at six. There was
nothing special to do. He would walk down,
and presently stop in at Brentano’s, then take the
car. He was very fond of seeing people group
themselves together and change like a kaleidoscope.
But his heart was sore and indignant,
and then his quick eye fell on the withered rose-buds
in the shrunken hand of the child, and after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
that adventure he had barely time to catch his
boat.
</p>
<p>
He hardly knew himself as he sat on the deck
till past midnight. Two little poverty-stricken
waifs had somehow changed his thoughts, his life.
When he was a little boy at Travis Farm a great
many curious ideas about heaven had floated
through his brain. And when his grandmother
sang in her soft, limpid voice,—
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;land&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;pure&nbsp;&nbsp;delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where&nbsp;&nbsp;saints&nbsp;&nbsp;immortal&nbsp;&nbsp;reign;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Infinite&nbsp;&nbsp;day&nbsp;&nbsp;excludes&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;night,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;pleasures&nbsp;&nbsp;banish&nbsp;&nbsp;pain,”<br />
</p>
<p>
he used to see it all as a vision. Perhaps his
ideas were not much wiser than those of poor little
ignorant Bess. He had travelled with Pilgrim;
he had known all the people on the way, and they
were real enough to him at that period.
</p>
<p>
Oh, how long ago that seemed! Everything
had changed since then. Science had uprooted
simple faith. One lived by sight now. The old
myths were still beautiful, of course. But long
before Christ came, the Greek philosophers had
prayed, and the Indian religions had had their
self-denying saviours.
</p>
<p>
But he had promised to find the way to heaven
for them, and they were so ignorant. He had
promised to go thither himself, and he had dipped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
into so many philosophies; he knew so much,
and yet he was so ignorant. But there must be
a heaven, that was one fact; and there must be a
way to go thither.
</p>
<p>
Sunday morning he was in Albany with Austin
and two young men he had known through the
winter. One of them was very attentive to a
pretty cousin who would be found at Travis Farm.
They had a leisurely elegant breakfast, they took
a carriage and drove about to points of interest,
had a course dinner, smoked and talked in the
evening. But the inner John was a little boy
again, and had gone to church with his grandmother.
The sermon was long, and he did not
understand it; but he read the hymns he liked,
and chewed a bit of fennel, and went almost
asleep. The singing was delightful, the spirited
old “Coronation.”
</p>
<p>
They went out to Travis Farm the next morning.
There was grandmother and Aunt Maria,
the single Miss Travis, Daisy Brockholst and her
dear friend Katharine Lee. Of course the young
people had a good time. They always did at
Travis Farm, and they were fond of coming.
</p>
<p>
“Grandmother,” John said, in a hesitating sort
of way, “you used to sing an old hymn I liked so
much,”
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;land&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;pure&nbsp;&nbsp;delight.”<br />
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span></div>
<p>
“Have you forgotten it? I wish you would sing
it for me,” and his hand slipped over hers.
</p>
<p>
“Why—yes, dear. I go singing about the
house for company when no one is here; but old
voices are apt to get thin in places, you know.”
</p>
<p>
He did not say he had hunted up an old hymn-book,
and read the words over and over. He was
ashamed that the children’s talk had taken such
hold of him. But presently he joined in, keeping
his really fine tenor voice down to a low key, and
they sang together.
</p>
<p>
Then there was the soft silence of a country
afternoon—the hushed sweetness of innumerable
voices that are always telling of God’s wonders.
</p>
<p>
“John,” she said, in her low, caressing sort of
tone that she had kept from girlhood, “I think
heaven won’t be quite perfect to me until I hear
your voice among the multitude no man can number.”
</p>
<p>
That was all. She had let her life of seventy-four
years do her preaching. But she still prayed
for her sheaves.
</p>
<p>
How had he come to have so much courage
on Saturday afternoon, and so little now? Of
course he could not be <em>quite</em> sure. And there
would be Austin’s incredulous laugh.
</p>
<p>
They went on to the Adirondacks. He made a
sketch of Bess, and sent it to a photographer’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
with instructions. He was delighted with the
artist group. He was planning out his winter.
He would take a studio with some one. He
would see what he could do for the Quinn children,
and paint his fine picture. <em>She</em> would see
it when it was exhibited somewhere. There would
be a curious satisfaction in it. And yet he was
carrying around with him every day three faded,
shrivelled wild-rose buds.
</p>
<p>
And then one day they brought in Austin
Travis insensible—dead, maybe. There was a little
blood stain on his face and his golden brown
beard; and it was an hour before they could restore
him to consciousness. Just by a miracle he had
been saved. A bit of rock that seemed so secure,
had been secure for centuries perhaps, split off,
taking him down with it. He had the presence
of mind to throw away his gun, but the fall had
knocked him insensible. He had lain some time
before the others found him. There were bruises,
a dislocated shoulder, and three broken ribs. Surgery
could soon mend those. But there was a
puncture in the magnificent lungs, such a little
thing to change all one’s life; and at first he
rebelled with a giant’s strength. Life was so
much to him, <em>all</em> to him. He could <em>not</em> go down
into nothingness with his days but half told.
</p>
<p>
Out of all the plans and advice it was settled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
to try the south of France, and perhaps the Madeira
Isles, to take such good care and have such
an equable climate that the wound might heal.
And John was to be his companion and nurse
and friend for all the lighter offices. Austin had
hardly allowed him to go out of his sight.
</p>
<p>
They had returned to New York. Everything
was arranged. Austin was impatient to be off before
cold weather. For three days John never
had a moment; but Bess and Dil had not been
out of his mind, and he could steal this afternoon;
so, with book and picture, he set out for Barker’s
Court, not much clearer about the way to heaven
than he had been six weeks before.
</p>
<p>
Barker’s Court was not inviting to-day, with its
piles of garbage, and wet clothes hanging about
like so many miserable ghosts.
</p>
<p>
“Is it Misses Quinn ye want, or old Granny
Quinn?” queried the woman he questioned.
“Granny lives up to th’ end, an’ Misses Quinn’s
is the third house, up-stairs.”
</p>
<p>
It was semi-twilight. He picked his way up
and knocked gently.
</p>
<p>
So gently, Dil was sure of a customer for her
mother. The babies were asleep. Bess was fixed
in her wagon. Dil had some patches of bright
colors that she was going to sew together, and
make a new carriage rug.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
</p>
<p>
She opened the door just a little way. He
pushed it wider, and glanced in.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, have you forgotten me?” he exclaimed.
“Did you think I would not come?”
</p>
<p>
Dil stood in a strange, sweet, guilty abasement.
She had disbelieved him. Bess gave a soft, thrilling
cry of delight, and stretched out her hands.
</p>
<p>
“I knew you would come,” and there was a
tremulous exaltation in her weak voice.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve only been in town a few days. I have
been staying with a cousin who met with a sad
accident and is still ill. But I have run away for
an hour or two; and I have brought Bess’s picture.”
</p>
<p>
He was taking a little survey of the room. The
stove shone. The floor was clean. The white
curtain made a light spot in the half gloom. The
warmth felt grateful, coming out of the chilly air,
though it was rather close. Dil did not look as
well as on the summer day. Her eyes were heavy,
with purple shadows underneath; the “bang” of
the morning had left some traces. And Bess was
wasted to a still frailer wraith, if such a thing was
possible.
</p>
<p>
They both looked up eagerly, as he untied the
package, and slipped out of an envelope a delicately
tinted photograph.
</p>
<p>
“There, blue eyes, will it do for Dil?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>
</p>
<p>
The child gave a rapturous cry. Dil stood
helpless from astonishment.
</p>
<p>
“There ain’t no words good enough,” Dil said
brokenly. “Leastways, I don’t know any. O
Bess, he’s made you look jes’ ’s if you was well.
O mister, will she look that way in heaven?”
For Dil had a vague misgiving she could never
look that way on earth.
</p>
<p>
“She will be more beautiful, because she will
never be ill again.”
</p>
<p>
“Dil’s right—there ain’t no words to praise
it,” Bess said simply. “If we was rich we’d give
you hundreds and hundreds of dollars, wouldn’t
we, Dil?”
</p>
<p>
Dil nodded. Her eyes were full of tears.
Something she had never known before struggled
within her, and almost rent her soul.
</p>
<p>
“And here is your book. You can read, of
course?”
</p>
<p>
“I can read some. Oh, how good you are to
remember.” She was deeply conscience stricken.
</p>
<p>
The tone moved him immeasurably. His eyelids
quivered. There were thousands of poor children
in the world, some much worse off than
these. He could not minister to all of them, but
he did wish he could put these two in a different
home.
</p>
<p>
“I must go away again with my cousin, and I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
am sorry. I meant to”—what <em>could</em> he do, he
wondered—“to see more of you this winter;
but a friend of mine will visit you, and bring you
a little gift now and then. You must have spent
all your money long ago,” flushing at the thought
of the paltry sum.
</p>
<p>
“We stretched it a good deal,” said Dil
quaintly. “You see, I bought Bess some clo’es,
there didn’t seem much comin’ in for her. An’
the fruit was so lovely. She’s been so meachin’.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I am going to be—did you ever read
Cinderella?” he asked eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t had much time for readin’, an’ Bess
couldn’t go to school but such a little while.”
</p>
<p>
“And no one has told you the story?”
</p>
<p>
There was a curious eagerness in the sort of
blank surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Well, this little Cinderella did kitchen work;
and sat in the chimney-corner when her work was
done, while her sisters dressed themselves up fine
and went to parties. One evening a curious old
woman came, a fairy godmother, and touched her
with a wand, a queer little stick she always carried,
and turned her old rags into silks and satins,
and made a chariot for her, and sent her to the
ball at the king’s palace.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” interposed Dil breathlessly, “she didn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
have to come back to her rags, an’ chimney, an’
all, did she?”
</p>
<p>
“She did come back, because her fairy godmother
told her to. But the king’s son sent for
her and married her.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if she’d only come to us, Dil!” Bess
had a quicker and more vivid imagination. She
had not been so hard worked, nor had her head
banged so many times. “We’d have the char—what
did you call it? an’ go to heaven. Then
you wouldn’t have to wheel me, Dil, an’ we’d get
along so much faster.” She laughed with a glad,
happy softness, and her little face was alight
with joy. “Say, mister, you must think I’ve got
heaven on the brain. But if you’d had hurted
legs so long, you’d want to get to the Lord Jesus
an’ have ’em made well. I keep thinkin’ over
what you told us ’bout your Lord Jesus, an’ I
know it’s true because you’ve come back.”
</p>
<p>
Such a little thing; such great faith! And he
had been comparing claims, discrepancies, and
wondering, questioning, afraid to believe a delusion.
Was he truly <em>his</em> Lord Jesus? The simple
belief of the children touched, melted him. It
was like finding a rare and exquisite blossom in
an arid desert. He wished he were not going
away. He would like to care for little Bess until
the time of her release came. Ah, would they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
be disillusioned when they came to know what
the real pilgrimage was?
</p>
<p>
“There ain’t no fairies truly,” said Dil with
pathetic gravity. “There ain’t much of anything
for poor people.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t take you to a palace; but when I come
back I mean you shall have a nice, comfortable
home in a prettier place—”
</p>
<p>
“Mother wouldn’t let Dil go on ’count of the
babies. There ain’t but two to-day, ’n’ she was
awful mad! ’N’ I wouldn’t go athout Dil. No
one else ’d know how to take care of me.”
</p>
<p>
“We will have that all right. And while I am
gone you must have some money to buy medicines
and the little luxuries your mother cannot
afford.”
</p>
<p>
“She don’t buy nothin’ ever. I ain’t no good,
’cause I’ll never walk, ’n’ only Dil cares about
me,” Bess said, as if she had so long accepted
the fact the sting was blunted.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I care; and I will send a friend here to
see you, a young lady, and you need not be afraid
to tell her of whatever you want. And Dil may
like to know—that I am going to put her in a
picture, and the money will be truly her own.”
</p>
<p>
He was not sure how much pride or personal
delicacy people of this class possessed.
</p>
<p>
“O Dil!” Bess was electrified with joy. “Oh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
I hope you made Dil look—just as she’d look if
we lived in one of them beautiful houses, ’n’ had
a maid ’n’ pretty clo’es, ’n’ no babies to take care
of. We never knowed any one like you afore.
Patsey’s awful good to us, but he ain’t fine like
an’ soft spoken. Are you very rich, mister?”
</p>
<p>
He laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Only middling, but rich enough to make life
a little pleasanter for you when I come back.”
</p>
<p>
She seemed to be studying him.
</p>
<p>
“You look as if you lived in some of the fine,
big houses. I’d like to go in wan. An’ you
know so much! You must have been to school a
good deal. Oh, how soft your hands are!”
</p>
<p>
She laughed delightedly as she enclosed one in
both of hers, and then pressed it to her cheek.
</p>
<p>
He stooped and kissed her. No one ever did
that but Dil and Patsey.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll surely come back in time to go to
heaven, soon as it’s pleasant weather,” she said
suddenly. “An’ Dil couldn’t be leaved behind.
Mother threatens to put her in a shop, an’ she
does bang her head cruel. But I wouldn’t want
to be in a pallis an’ have everything, if I couldn’t
have Dil. An’ you’ll get it all fixed so’s we can
go?”
</p>
<p>
Ah, ah! before that time Bess would have been
folded in the everlasting arms. There was a lump
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
in his throat, and he began to untie the string
of the book to evade a more decisive answer.
</p>
<p>
It was an illustrated edition, simplified for
children’s reading. He turned some of the leaves
and found one picture—Christiana ascending the
palace steps amid a host of angels.
</p>
<p>
From this squalid place and poverty, to that—how
could he explain the steps between? When
he came back Bess would be gone—
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Past&nbsp;&nbsp;night,&nbsp;&nbsp;past&nbsp;&nbsp;day,”<br />
</p>
<p>
and he would give Dil a new and better chance
in spite of her mother.
</p>
<p>
Dil drew a long, long breath.
</p>
<p>
“Can we all get to the pallis?” she asked,
with a soft awe in her tone.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, there are many things to do—you will
see what Christiana and Mercy did. And if you
love the Lord Jesus and pray to him—”
</p>
<p>
Poor Dil was again conscience smitten. Only
this morning she had said praying wasn’t any
good. She glanced up through tears,—
</p>
<p>
“’Pears as if I couldn’t ever get to understand.
I wasn’t smart at school—”
</p>
<p>
“But you <em>are</em> smart,” interposed Bess. “An’
now we’ve got the book we’ll find just how
Christiana went. There’s only six months left.
You’ll surely be back by April?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
“I shall be back.” His heart smote him. He
was a coward after all. Ah, could he ever undertake
any of the Master’s business?
</p>
<p>
“Do you remember a hymn an old lady sang
for you once?” he said, glad of even this faltering
way out. “I have been learning the words.”
</p>
<p>
“’Bout everlasting spring?” and Bess’s eyes
were alight. “Oh, do please sing it! I’m in
such an awful hurry for spring to come. Sometimes
my breath gets so short, as if I reely
couldn’t wait.”
</p>
<p>
Dil raised her eyes with a slow, beseeching
movement. He pushed a chair beside the wagon,
and held Bess’s small hands, that were full of
leaping pulses.
</p>
<p>
The sweet old hymn, almost forgotten amid the
clash of modern music. Ah, there was some one
who would love and care for Dil in her desolation—his
grandmother. He would write to her.
Then he began, and at the first note the children
were enraptured:—
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There&nbsp;&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;land&nbsp;&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;pure&nbsp;&nbsp;delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where&nbsp;&nbsp;saints&nbsp;&nbsp;immortal&nbsp;&nbsp;reign;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fearless&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;launch&nbsp;&nbsp;away.”<br />
</p>
<p>
John Travis had a tender, sympathetic voice.
Just now he was more moved by emotion than he
would have imagined. Dil turned her face away
and picked up the tears with her fingers. It was
too beautiful to cry about, for crying was associated
with sorrow or pain. A great inarticulate
desire thrilled through her, a blind, passionate
longing for a better, higher life, as if she belonged
somewhere else. And, like Bess, an impatience
pervaded her to be gone at once.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, please do sing it again!” besought Bess
in a transport, her face spiritualized to a seraphic
beauty. “Did they sing like that in the Mission
School, Dil?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
Dil shook her head in speechless ecstasy.
</p>
<p>
There was a knock, and then the door opened
softly. It was Mrs. Murphy, with her sick baby
in her arms.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, dear,” she began deprecatingly, with an
odd little old country courtesy, “I heard the singing,
an’ I said to poor old Mis’ Bolan, ‘That’s
never the Salvation Army, for they do make such
a hullabaloo; but it must be a Moody an’ Sankey
man that I wunst haird, with the v’ice of an
angel.’ An’ the pore craythur is a hankerin’ to
get nearer. Will ye lit her come down, plaise, or
will ye come up?”
</p>
<p>
John Travis flushed suddenly. Dil glanced at
her visitor aghast. Some finer instinct questioned
whether he were offended. But he smiled. If it
would give a poor old woman a pleasure—
</p>
<p>
Dil was considering a critical point. She had
learned to be wise in evading the fury of a half-drunken
woman. There were many things she
kept to herself. But Mrs. Murphy would talk
<em>him</em> over. A Moody and Sankey man,—she had
not a very clear idea; but if Mrs. Murphy knew,
it might be wisdom to have some one here who
would speak a good word for her if it should be
needed.
</p>
<p>
“Ye can bring her down,” she answered, still
looking at John Travis with rising color.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>
</p>
<p>
She simply stepped into the hall; but the old
woman was half-way down-stairs, and needed no
further summons.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, dear, it’s the v’ice of an angel shure.
An’ though I’m not given to them kind of maytins,
on account of the praist, they do be beautiful
an’ comfortin’ whiles they sing. Come in.
It’s Dilly Quinn that’ll bid ye welcome. For it’s
the Moody an’ Sankey man.”
</p>
<p>
“Yer very good, Dilly Quinn, very good, to
ask in a poor old woman; though I’m main
afeared of yer mother in a tantrum.” Her voice
was shrill and shaky, though she was not seventy;
but poverty and hardships age people fast. A
bowed and shrunken woman, with thin, white,
straggling hair, watery, hungry-looking eyes, a
wrinkled, ashen skin, her lips a leaden blue and
sunken from lack of teeth. She had one of Mrs.
Murphy’s rooms since the head of the house was
safely bestowed within prison limits. Mrs. Bolan’s
only son had been killed in the war, and she had
her pension. Now and then some one gave her a
little work out of pity.
</p>
<p>
She dropped down on the lounge. “When I
heard that there hymn,” she went on quaveringly,
“it took me back forty year an’ more. There
was great revival meetin’s. My poor old mother
used to sing it. But meetin’s don’t seem the same
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
any more, or else we old folks kinder lost the
end er r’ligion.”
</p>
<p>
She was so pitiful, with her timorous, lonely
look, and the hard struggles time had written on
her everywhere.
</p>
<p>
“Will you sing it for her?” Dil asked timidly,
glancing up at Travis.
</p>
<p>
Some one else paused to listen and look in, and
stared with strange interest at the fine young
fellow, whose rich, deep voice found a way to
their hearts. And as he sang, a realization of
their pinched, joyless lives filled him with dismay.
Mrs. Bolan rocked herself too and fro, her hands
clutched tightly over her breast, as if she was
hugging some comfort she could not afford to let
go. The tears rolled silently down her furrowed
cheeks.
</p>
<p>
The foreign part of the audience was more
outspoken.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, did yez iver listen to the loikes! Shure,
it would move the heart of a sthone. It’s enough
to take yez right t’ro’ to heaven widout the laste
taste o’ purgatory. Shure, Mrs. Kelly, it’s like a
pack o’ troubles fallin’ off, an’ ye step out light
an’ strong to yer work agen. There’ll be a
blissin’ for ye, young man, for the pleasure ye’ve
given.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Bolan shuffled forward and caught his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
hand in hers, which seemed almost to rattle, they
were so bony.
</p>
<p>
“God bless you, sir.” Her voice was so broken
it sounded like sobs. “An’ there’s something
’bout makin’ his face shine on you—I disremember,
it’s so long since I’ve read my Bible, more
shame to me; but my eyes are so old and bad, I
hope the Lord won’t lay it up agen me. I’m a
poor old body, pushed outen the ranks. And you
get kicked aside. Ye see, ’tain’t every voice that
takes one to heaven. Lord help us ’bout gettin’ in.
But mebbe he’ll be merciful to all who go astray.
An’—if ye wouldn’t mind sayin’ a bit of prayer,
’pears like ’twould comfort me to my dyin’ day.”
</p>
<p>
Her hungry eyes pleaded through their tears.
</p>
<p>
A bit of prayer! He had been praying a little
for himself of late, but it came awkward after his
years of intellectual complacency. A youngish
woman was glancing at him in frightened desperation,
as if she waited for something to turn her
very life. There was but one thing he could
think of in this stress—the divine mandate.
Could anything be more complete? When ye
pray, say,—
</p>
<p>
“Our Father which art in heaven—”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>VI—A WONDERFUL STORY</h2>
<p>
John Travis stood with upraised hand.
Clearly, slowly, the words fell, and you could
hear only the labored respiration of the women.
There was a benediction—he could not recall
it, but a verse of Scripture came into his mind.
<em>“Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto
you: not as the world giveth give I unto you. Let
not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.”</em>
</p>
<p>
“The Lord will bless you,” said the trembling
old woman.
</p>
<p>
He squeezed something into her hand as she
turned to go. Mrs. Murphy’s sickly baby began
to cry, and one of Dil’s woke up. The little
crowd dispersed.
</p>
<p>
It began to grow dusky. Night came on early
in Barker’s Court. Days were shorter, and sunless
at that.
</p>
<p>
Travis stepped back to Bess.
</p>
<p>
“I shall ask my friend to tell me all about you—she
will write it. And I shall come back.” He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
stooped and kissed Bess on the brow, for the last
time. Heaven help her on her lonely journey.
But the Saviour who blessed little children would
be tender of her surely.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll all go—won’t we—to heaven? The
singin’ was so beautiful. An’ the everlastin’
spring.”
</p>
<p>
“Good-by.” He clasped Dil’s hand. “Remember,
wherever you are, I shall find you. Oh,
do not be afraid, God will care for you.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t seem to understand ’bout God,” and
there was a great, strange awe in Dil’s eyes.
“But you’ve been lovely. I can understand
that.”
</p>
<p>
One more glance at Bess, whose face was lighted
with an exalted glow, as if she were poised, just
ready for flight. Oh, what could comfort Dil when
she was gone? And <em>he</em> had so much! He was
so rich in home and love.
</p>
<p>
A woman stood in the lower hallway, the half-despairing
face he had noted. She clutched his
arm.
</p>
<p>
“See here,” she cried. “You said, ‘deliver us
from evil.’ Is anybody—is God strong enough
to do it? From horrible evil—when there seems
no other way open—when you must see some
one you love—die starvin’—an’ no work to be
had—O my God!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
</p>
<p>
The cry pierced him. Yes, there was a beneficent
power in money. He gave thanks for it, as
he crushed it in her hand. How did the poor
souls live, herded in this narrow court? His
father’s stable was a palace to it in cleanliness.
</p>
<p>
He had reasoned about poverty being one of
the judicious forces of the world. He had studied
its picturesque aspects, its freedom from care and
responsibility, its comfortable disregard of conventionals,
its happy indifference to custom and
opinion. Did these people look joyous and content?
Why, their faces even now haunted him
with the weight of hopeless sorrow. Oh, what
could he do to ease the burthen of the world?
</p>
<p>
Dil picked up the baby after she had lighted
the lamp. She was still in a maze, as if some
vision had come and gone. Was he really here?
Or had she been in a blissful dream?
</p>
<p>
“Come an’ spell out what he’s written—an’—an’
his name, Dil!”
</p>
<p>
Bess was studying the fly-leaf. Yes, there it
was, “John Travis.”
</p>
<p>
“I wisht it wasn’t John,” said Bess, a little
disappointed. “He ought to have a fine, grand
name, he’s so splendid. Rich people have nice
ways, that poor people can’t seem to get.”
</p>
<p>
“No, they can’t get ’em, they can’t,” Dil repeated,
with a despairing sense of the gulf between. She had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
never thought much about rich
people before.
</p>
<p>
“You’d better hide the book, an’ the money,
’fore Owny comes in,” said Bess fearfully. “I
don’t even dast to look at the pictures. But we’ll
have it a good many days when mammy’s out, an’
I must learn to read the hard words. O Dil! if I
had two good legs, I would jump for joy.”
</p>
<p>
Dil wanted to sit down and cry from some unknown
excess of feeling—she never had time to
cry from pure joy. But she heeded Bess’s admonition,
and hid their precious gifts. Then she
stirred the fire and put on the potatoes. It was
beginning to rain, and the boys came in noisily.
The babies went home, and they had supper.
</p>
<p>
It was quite late when Mrs. Quinn returned
home, and she threw a bundle on the lounge.
The boys being in, and Bess out of the way, she
had nothing to scold about. She had had her
day’s work praised, and a good supper in the bargain.
Then cook had given her a “drap of the
craythur” to keep out the cold. And she could
have two days’ work every week “stiddy,” so she
resolved to throw over some poorer customer.
</p>
<p>
But when Mrs. Murphy came down with a few
potatoes in her hand that she had borrowed, and
full of her wonderful news, Dil’s heart sank within
her like lead.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
“An’ what do ye think?” the visitor began incautiously.
“Poor old Mrs. Bolan is half wild with
all the singin’ an’ the beautiful prisint he gev
her.”
</p>
<p>
“What prisint?” asked Mrs. Quinn peremptorily.
</p>
<p>
“Why, it was a five-dollar bill. I thought first
she’d faint clear away wid joy.”
</p>
<p>
“What man?” eying them both suspiciously.
</p>
<p>
Dil’s lips moved, but her throat was so dry
she could not utter a sound.
</p>
<p>
“Wan of them Moody an’ Sankey men that
do be singin’ around, an’ prayin’. An’ ye niver
heard sich an’ iligant v’ice even at the free and
easies! Why, Mrs. Quinn, it’s my belafe, in spite
of the praist, he cud draw a soul out o’ purgatory
just wid his singin’. Mrs. Bolan’s that ’raptured
she does nothin’ but quaver about wid her shaky
old v’ice. Ah, dear—ave ye cud hev heard
him!”
</p>
<p>
“To the divil wid him! Comin’ round to git
money out’v poor folks. I knows ’em. Dil, did
you give him a cint?”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t have any; but he didn’t ast for none,”
and the poor child had hard work to steady her
voice.
</p>
<p>
“An’ ye’r mistaken, Mrs. Quinn, if ye think
the likes of sich a gentleman would be beggin’ of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
the poor,” returned Mrs. Murphy indignantly.
“An’ he a-gevin a poor ould craythur five dollars!
An’ they do be goin’ around a-missionin’ with
their prayers and hymns.”
</p>
<p>
“I know ’em. An’ the praists an’ the sisters
beggin’ the last cint, an’ promisin’ to pray ye
outen purgatory! Mrs. Murphy,” with withering
contempt, “them men cuddent pray ye outen a
sewer ditch if ye fell in! An’ I won’t have them
comin’ here—ye hear that, Dilsey Quinn! If I
catch a Moody an’ Sankey man here, I’ll break
ivery bone in his body, an’ yours too; ye hear
that now!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn was evidently “spilin’ for a fight.”
Mrs. Murphy went off in high dudgeon without
another word.
</p>
<p>
But she stopped to pour out her grievance to
Mrs. Garrick on her floor.
</p>
<p>
“Shure, I pity them childers, for their mother
do be the worst haythen an’ infidel, not belayvin’
a word about her own sowl, an’ spindin’ her money
for gin as she do. She was a foine-lukin’ woman,
an’ now her eyes is all swelled up, an’ her nose the
color of an ould toper. An’ that poor little Bess
dyin’ afore her very eyes widout a bit of a mass,
or even christenin’ I belayve. I’m not that bigoted,
Mrs. Garrick, though the praists do say
there bees but the wan way. I’m willin’ that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
people shall try their own ways, so long as they
save their sowls; but pore, helpless bits of childer
that can’t know! An’ what are their mothers
put in the wurruld for but to tache them? But
when ye don’t belayve ye have a sowl of yer own
it’s awful! There’s them b’ys runnin’ wild—an’
a moighty good thing it’ll be whin they’re in the
’form-school, kapin’ out o’ jail, an’ wuss!”
</p>
<p>
Dil sat in awful fear when the door had closed
behind their neighbor. She took up Owen’s
trousers—the rent was sufficient to send any
boy early to bed.
</p>
<p>
That recalled her mother. She threw the bundle
towards Dil.
</p>
<p>
“There’s some clo’es ye kin be fixin’ up for
Dan, whin ye’ve so much time as to be spindin’
it on Moody and Sankey men, drat ’em! foolin’
’round an’ wastin’ valyble time. Next I’ll hear
that ye’ve ast in the organ man an’ the monkey,
and I’ll come home to find ye givin’ a pairty. An’
ye’ll hev yer head broke for it, that ye will!”
</p>
<p>
So long as it was not broken now, Dil gave
secret thanks. Did God help any? Then, why
didn’t he help other times when things were very
bad? She examined the suit, and found it a nice
one, rather large for Dan, who was not growing
like a weed, although he ran the streets.
</p>
<p>
Her mother began to snore. She would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
good for some hours’ sound sleep. So Dil stole
into the little room, and began to prepare Bess for
bed, though she trembled with a half fear.
</p>
<p>
“O Dil, I didn’t hardly dast to breathe! An’
if she’d known <em>he</em> come in here an’ sung, she’d
murdered us! An’ it made me feel glad like that
he was goin’ away, for mammy might happen to
be home when he come—though don’t you b’lieve
he’d take us away right then? An’—an’ wasn’t
it lucky you didn’t have to tell about the—”
</p>
<p>
Bess held the bill up in her hand.
</p>
<p>
“Le’s put it in the book, an’ hide the book in
the bottom of the wagon. An’, Dil, I can’t help
feeling light like, as if I was goin’ to float. Think
of that splendid place, an’ no night, an’ no winter,
an’ all beautiful things. Oh, I wisht he’d gev us
the words too; I’m most sure I could sing ’em.
An’ the best of all is that mammy won’t be there,
cause, you see, ’twouldn’t please her any, and I’d
be awful feared. She’d ruther stay here an’ drink
gin.”
</p>
<p>
They had not gone far enough in the Christian
life, poor ignorant little souls, to have much missionary
spirit. But they kissed, and kissed softly,
in the half-dark, and cried a little—tender tears
touched with a sadness that was as sweet as joy.
</p>
<p>
Dil stepped about cautiously, emptied the grate,
and did up her night-work. There seemed a certainty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
about heaven that she had not experienced
before, a confidence in John Travis that gave her
a stubborn faith. He would surely return in the
spring. They would go out some day and never,
never come back to Barker’s Court.
</p>
<p>
She fell asleep in her visionary journey when
she was up beyond Central Park. She was always
so tired, and this night quite exhausted.
But Bess kept floating on a sea of delicious
sound; and if ever one had visions of the promised
land, it was Bessy Quinn.
</p>
<p>
There were seven babies in the next morning,
it being a sharp, clear day. Mrs. Quinn had gone
off about her business with no row. When Bess
had been dressed and had her breakfast, they
drew out the precious book.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll jes’ cover it with a bit of old calico an’ no
one will mistrust, for you can jes’ slip it down in
the carriage. An’ we’ll get out that old speller of
Owny’s, so mother can see that around if we do
be taken by s’prise.”
</p>
<p>
They looked at the pictures as the babies would
allow them the leisure, and spelled out the explanation
underneath. It was so wonderful, though
at times they were appalled by the difficulties and
dangers. And it was almost night when they
reached the crowning-point of all,—Christiana
going across the river.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
<em>“All the banks beyond the river were full of
horses and chariots which were come down from
above to accompany her to the City Gate.”</em> Her
friends were thronging round. She was entering
the river with a fearless step and uplifted face.
</p>
<p>
“Why, Dil, she jes’ walked right acrost.” Bess
gave a joyous little laugh. “You see, she couldn’t
get drownded, because that Lord Jesus had made
it all right an’ safe, jes’ as he carried people in his
arms. I’m so glad we know. You see, when we
get to the river, an’ it will be way, way above
Cent’l Park, when we’ve been through these
giants an’ all—an’ I’m <em>’most</em> afraid of thim; but
the man did not let ’em hurt her, an’ <em>he</em>, our man,
won’t let ’em hurt us. An’ we’ll jest step right
in the river,—maybe <em>he’ll</em> carry me acrost on
account of my poor little legs,—an’ we sha’n’t be
a mite afraid, for he won’t let us drown. O Dil,
it’ll be so lovely! An’ here’s the pallis!”
</p>
<p>
There was the “throng that no man can number,”
welcoming Christiana. Angels with spreading
wings and rapturous faces. Her husband
coming to meet her, and the Lord Jesus ministering
an abundant welcome.
</p>
<p>
What a day it was! Never was day so short,
so utterly delightful. Some of the babies were
cross: out of seven little poorly born and poorly
nourished babies, there were wants and woes; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
Dil hugged them, cuddled them, crooned to them,
with a radiant bliss she had never known before.
She could look so surely at the end.
</p>
<p>
An old debt of half a dollar came in, and there
were thirty-five cents for the babies. Dan had on
his new suit too, and altogether Mrs. Quinn was
remarkably good-natured. Dil felt almost conscience-smitten
about the book—but then the
story would have to come out, and alas!
</p>
<p>
After that they began to read the wonderful
story. Dil was not much of a scholar. Her
school-days had been few and far between, never
continuous enough to give her any real interest.
Indeed, she had not been bright at her books, and
her mother had not cared. School was something
to fill up the time until children were old enough
to go to work. But Dil surely had enough to fill
up her time.
</p>
<p>
Bess would have far outstripped her in learning.
But Dil had a shrewd head, and was handy with
her needle. She possessed what Yankee people
call “faculty;” and her training had given her a
sharp lookout for any short cuts in what she
had to do, as well as a certain tact in evading or
bridging over rough places.
</p>
<p>
But the reading was very hard labor. They
did not know the meaning or the application of
words, and their pronouncing ability was indeed
halting.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
They had not even attained to the practical
knowledge acquired by mingling with other children.
Dil’s life had been pathetic in its solitariness,
like the loneliness of a strange crowd. Other
children had not “taken to her.” Her days had
been all work. She would have felt awkward and
out of place playing with anything but a baby.
</p>
<p>
Bess found the most similitudes in Christiana.
Even John Travis would have been amused by her
literal interpretation. Though it had been simplified
for children’s reading, it was far above their
limited capacity. But the pictures helped so
much; and when Dil could not get “the straight
of it,” when the spiritual part tried and confused
their brains, they turned to Christiana crossing
the river and entering heaven.
</p>
<p>
Valiant Mr. Greatheart appealed strongly to
Bess.
</p>
<p>
“He’s got such a strong, beautiful name,” she
declared enthusiastically. “He always comes
when there’s troubles, an’ gettin’ lost, an’ all that.
I ’most wish <em>his</em> name was Mr. Greatheart. He
could fight, I know; not this common, hateful
fightin’ down here in the court, but with giants
an’ wild beasts. An’ there were the boys, Dil;
but I s’pose Owny wouldn’t care ’bout goin’.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” Dil hesitated curiously, “you’ve got
to try to be good some way, an’ Owny wouldn’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>
quit swearin’ an’ snivyin’ when he got a chance.
An’ I don’t think he’d understand. Then he
might tell mammy ’bout our plans.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ mammy jes’ wouldn’t let you stir a step,
I know. An’ I couldn’t go athout you, Dil, though
there’ll be many people on the road. I was most
feared it would be lonesome like.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ I’ll be gettin’ a few clo’es ready, the best
of thim. I’ll wash an’ iron your new white dress
when we don’t go out no more, an’ put it away
kerful. An’ I hope some one will give mother
some clo’es for a big girl! I’ll be so glad to go,
for sometimes I’m so tired I jes’ want to drop.”
</p>
<p>
“But October’s ’most gone. An’ last winter
don’t seem long to me now, an’ the summer that
was so hot,—but it had that beautiful Sat’day
when we found <em>him</em>. An’ to think of havin’ him
forever ’n’ ever!”
</p>
<p>
Dil gave a long sigh. She was as impatient as
Bess, but she hardly dared set her heart upon the
hope.
</p>
<p>
She was a very busy little woman, and her mind
had to be on her work. The garments given to the
boys had, of course, the best taken out of them,
and Owen was hard on his clothes. As for the
stockings, their darning was a work of labor, if
not of love. Bess had to be kept warm and comfortable,
and Dil tried to make her pretty as well.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
There were some rainy Saturdays, and the one
baby often came in that day. But she tried to
give Bess an airing on Sunday. It was such a
change for the poor little invalid.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn was better pleased to be busy all
the time. Besides the money, which was really
needed now that fires were more expensive, she
liked the change, the gossiping and often it was
a pleasure to find fault with her customers. She
still went to Mrs. MacBride’s of an evening.
</p>
<p>
With the advent of November came a week of
glorious Indian summer weather. And one Saturday
Mrs. Quinn was to do some cleaning at a
fine house, and stay to help with a grand dinner.
Dil rushed through with her work, and they went
up to the Square that afternoon, and sat in the
old place. The sparrows came and chirped cheerfully;
but the flowers were gone, the trees leafless.
Yet it was delightful to picture it all again.
</p>
<p>
John Travis would have felt sorry for Dil to-day—perhaps
if he had seen her for the first time he
would not have been so instantly attracted. Her
eyes were heavy, her skin dark and sodden. Even
Bess grew weary with the long ride. But they
shopped a little again; and Dil was extravagant
enough to buy some long, soft woollen stockings
for Bess’s “poor, hurted legs.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m so tired,” she said afterward. “’Tain’t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
quite like summer, is it? Make up a good fire,
Dil, an’ get me snappin’ warm.”
</p>
<p>
She did not want much to eat. Even the grapes
had lost their flavor.
</p>
<p>
“I wish you could sing that beautiful hymn,”
she said to Dil. “I’d just like to hear it, ’cause
it keeps floatin’ round all the time, an’ don’t get
quite near enough. O Dil! don’t you s’pose you
can sing in heaven?”
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me I heard at the Mission School
that everybody would. If the Lord Jesus can
mend your legs, I’m sure he can put some music
in my throat.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll ask him right away. Then read to me
a little.”
</p>
<p>
Bess fell asleep presently. Dil made slow work
spelling out the words and not knowing half the
meanings. Her seasons at the Mission School
had always been brief, from various causes. Now
and then some visitor came in, but the talk was
often in phrases that Dil did not understand.
She had not a quick comprehension, neither was
she an imaginative child.
</p>
<p>
Looking now at Bess’s pinched and pallid face
a strange fear entered her mind. Would Bess be
strong enough in the spring to take the long journey?
For it was so much longer than she imagined,
and Bess couldn’t be made well until they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
reached the Lord Jesus. There was a vague misgiving
tugging at her heart. They ought to have
gone that lovely Saturday.
</p>
<p>
They talked so much about John Travis that
they almost forgot what he had said about his
friend. They were husbanding their small resources
for the time of need. There had been
so many babies that Dil had not needed to make
up deficiencies. Sometimes they felt quite afraid
of their hiding-place, and Dil made a little bag
and put it around Bess’s neck, so no one would
come upon the money unaware.
</p>
<p>
The touch of Indian summer was followed by a
storm and cool, brisk winds. It was too cold to
take Bess out, even if she had cared; but she had
been rather drooping all the week. There was a
baby in, also, and Bess kept in her own room, as
she often did Saturday morning, to be out of the
way of her mother’s sharp frowns.
</p>
<p>
Dil had gone of an errand. Mrs. Quinn sat
furbishing up an ulster she had bought at a second-hand
store at a great bargain. The baby was
asleep on the lounge. When Dil returned, a
dreadful something met her on the threshold that
made her very heart stand still.
</p>
<p>
“I have come from a Mr. Travis, to see the
children. He has gone abroad, and he asked me
to look after them.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
</p>
<p>
This was what had gone before—very little,
indeed. Mrs. Quinn had answered, “Come in,” to
a tap at the door; and there had entered a rather
pretty, well-dressed, well-bred young woman, who
considered herself quite an important member of
the charitable world. She saw a clean-looking
room with more comforts than usual, and she
gave a sharp glance around the corners.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn received her very civilly, considering
her a possible customer.
</p>
<p>
“You have a little girl who is an invalid, I believe?”
she queried.
</p>
<p>
“That I have,” was the brief reply.
</p>
<p>
The stranger glanced at the two open doors,
and wondered; was the child in bed?
</p>
<p>
The next sentence was what Dil had caught.
Miss Nevins checked herself suddenly. Mr. Travis
had said, “See the children alone if you can.
Their mother is out to work most of the time, and
it will be an easy matter. But do not give any
money to the woman for them; they will not
get it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well—what?” asked Mrs. Quinn sharply,
with an aspect that rather nonplussed the lady.
“Whin did he see so much of thim, an’ come to
think they needed his attintion?”
</p>
<p>
“Why—when he was here—”
</p>
<p>
“Was he here now? an’ what called him?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn gave her visitor an insolent stare
that rendered her very uncomfortable.
</p>
<p>
“I—I really do not know <em>when</em>. Kindly disposed
people <em>do</em> visit the sick and the needy. I
go to a great many places—”
</p>
<p>
“Av ye plaise,” she interrupted, “we’re not
paupers. I’m well enough, ye see, to be takin’
care of me own childers. An’ he nor no one else
nade throubble theirselves. I’m not askin’ charity;
an’ av they did it unbeknownst to me, I’ll
hammer thim well, that I will! They’re as well
off as common folk, an’ ye needn’t be worritin’.
Av that’s all ye come fer, ye kin be goin’ about
yer own bisniss, bedad! An’ ye kin tell Mr.
What’s-his-name that I’m not sufferin’ fer help.”
</p>
<p>
This was not the fashion in which Miss Nevins
was generally received. “You do not understand”—with
rising color. “We desire to be
of whatever service we can; and if your child is
ill, you cannot have a better friend—”
</p>
<p>
“Frind! is it? Bedad, I kin choose me own
frinds! An’ if he knows whin he’s well off, he’ll
not show his foine forrum here, er his mug’ll get
a party mash on it. Frind, indade!”
</p>
<p>
The irate woman looked formidable as she rose,
but Miss Nevins did not mean to be daunted.
</p>
<p>
“You may see the time when you will be glad
of a friend, though you need not worry about <em>his</em>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
coming. I shall tell him you are not worth his
interest. As for the child”—and her indignation
sparkled in her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“The child wants none of his help, ye kin tell
him. I kin look afther her mesilf.”
</p>
<p>
“Good-day,” and the visitor opened the door.
Dil stepped back in the obscurity. The lady
held up her fine cloth gown, and gave her nose
a haughty wrinkle or two as she inhaled the stifling
air once, and then did not breathe until she
was in the court.
</p>
<p>
“Such a horrid hole!” she commented. “The
child ought to be moved to a hospital—or perhaps
she is well by this time. John is so easily
taken in—his swans so often turn out to be
geese. As if <em>I</em> would have given her any money,
the impudent, blowsy thing! I know pretty well
how far to trust that class! Though it’s rather
funny,” and she smiled in the midst of her disgust;
“they are always whining and pleading poverty,
and will be abject enough for a quarter.
And she was very high and mighty! I’ll write a
good long letter to John about it, but I won’t
trouble her ladyship again.”
</p>
<p>
Dil stood shaking with terror, and some moments
elapsed before she had courage enough to
open the door. She was in a degree prepared for
a line of defence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
</p>
<p>
Her mother seized her by the arm, and fairly
shouted at her,—
</p>
<p>
“Who was the man who kim to see ye, ye
young huzzy?”
</p>
<p>
“Man! When did a man come? I don’t remember,”
assuming surprise.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll help yer mem’ry thin wid that;” and Dil’s
ears rang with the sound of the blow.
</p>
<p>
“There wasn’t any man since the wan that sang
a long whiles ago. Mrs. Murphy knew. She said
he was a Moody an’ Sankey man, an’ that they do
be goin’ round singin’ and prayin’. An’ they all
stood in the hall, the women about. Mrs. Murphy
kin tell you.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn was rather nonplussed.
</p>
<p>
“What did he gev ye?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothin’,” sobbed Dil. “It was poor old Mrs.
Bolan that had the money.”
</p>
<p>
“Not a cint?” She took Dil by the shoulder.
“Dil Quinn, I don’ no whether to belave yer; but
if he’d gev ye any money, an’ ye’d bin such a
deceivin’ little thafe, I’d break ivery bone in yer
mean little body. Howld yer tongue! I ain’t
done nothin’ but ast a civil question.”
</p>
<p>
Dil tried to stop sobbing. Her mother was in
a hurry to get out, or matters might have been
worse.
</p>
<p>
“Stop yer snivelin’,” commanded her mother.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>
“But if I hear of any more men singin’ round, I’ll
make ye wish yer never been born.”
</p>
<p>
The baby cried at this juncture, and Dil took it
up. Mrs. Quinn went out, and there would be
peace until midnight.
</p>
<p>
Bess sat in the carriage, wild-eyed and ghostly,
trembling in every limb.
</p>
<p>
“It was a norful lie!” sobbed Dil. “But if I’d
told her, she’d killed me! <em>He</em> wouldn’t a done
such a thing; but nobody’d darst to tackle him,
an’ rich people don’t beat an’ bang.”
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t tell no lie,” said Bess in a sudden
strong voice. “<em>He</em> never gev you no money.
’Twarn’t your money ’t all. Doncher know he
put it in the bag the first time when you was
feared to take it, an’ he jes’ dropped it down here
in the side of the kerrige. He never gev you a
penny. An’ it was <em>my</em> money.”
</p>
<p>
“O Bess! Ye’r such a bright, smart little
thing! If you’d been well we’d just kept ahead
of mother all the time;” and now the sunshine
slanted over the brown quartz eyes that were
swimming in tears. “I d’n’ know, but I should
have hated norful to tell a lie ’bout him. He
seems—well, I can’t somehow git the right
words; but’s if you wanted to be all on the
square when he liked you. I don’t b’leve he’d
so much mind yer snivyin’ out a nickel when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
there was a good many babies, an’ puttin’ it back
when there wasn’t, to save gettin’ yer head
busted. But he wouldn’t tell no lie. He kem
when he said he would an’ brought Christiana,
an’ he’ll come in the spring, sure.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sure,” said Bess, with a faint smile.
“But you better ast Mrs. Murphy to keep the
book a few days, for mammy might go snoopin’
about—”
</p>
<p>
“I just will; but I don’t b’leve she’d dast to
hustle you round and find the money. An’ now
a week’s gone, an’ there’s only three left, en
then it’ll be anuther month, an’ O Bess, spring!
spring!”
</p>
<p>
There was an exultant gladness in Dil’s voice.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>VII—MARTYRED CHRISTIANA.</h2>
<p>
Dil was always so tired, she went to sleep at
once from exhaustion. But to-night every nerve
seemed in a quiver. They had found some medicine
that soothed Bess and kept her from coughing,
so she slept better than in the summer. Dil
tossed and tumbled. There had been given her
a magnificent endowment of physical strength,
and the dull apathy of poverty had kept her from
a prodigal waste of nerve force. She was what
people often called stolid, but she had never been
roused. How many poor souls live and die with
most of their energies dormant.
</p>
<p>
There had never been but one dream to Dil’s
life, and that was Bess. Here her imagination
had some play. When they took their outings
through the more respectable streets for the
cleanliness and quiet, or paused awhile in the
green and flowery squares, she sometimes “made
believe” that Bess was the lovely child in the
elegant carriage, with wraps of eider down and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
lace, and she the nurse-maid in white apron and
cap who trundled her along jauntily. Or else it
was Bess, blue-eyed and golden-haired, sitting in
a real “grown-up” carriage with her pretty mamma
in silks and satins. The little nurse-maid was at
home, putting everything in order, and waiting for
the lovely princess to come back and tell her all
she had seen. That and heaven had been the
extent of her romancing.
</p>
<p>
But to-night a curious, separate life stirred
within her. A consciousness of the great difference
between such people as John Travis, even
the lady in the hall who had so disdainfully gathered
up her skirts and scattered a faint fragrance
about. Why was such a great difference made?
Why should she and Bess be Honor Quinn’s children?
Would another mother be given them in
heaven?
</p>
<p>
The mothers in the court seemed to love their
little babies, yet afterward they beat and banged
them about. But the children in that clean, beautiful
world where there was no pain, the children
in heaven—ah! ah! She was not crying with
human passion; it was the deep anguish of the
soul that cannot even find vent in tears, the
throes of an awful inward pain, that seldom, thank
God, comes to the young, that dense ignorance
often keeps from the very poor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
</p>
<p>
“Took them in his arms.” That was what
John Travis had said. She was so tired to-night—not
the fatigue of hard work altogether, but a
great aching that had no name. If she could be
taken in some one’s arms! Dilsey Quinn could
not remember being held, though her mother had
been proud of her first-born, and fond too, in
those days.
</p>
<p>
If Mrs. Quinn’s life had been a little more prosperous,
if she had lived in a cottage with a patch
of ground, a cow and some chickens, and the
wholesome surroundings of the little village where
she had reigned a sort of rural queen, her children
might have known love and tenderness. But
the babies had come fast. Her man had taken to
drink. They were crowded in among the poor
and ignorant, where brawls and oaths, drinking
and cruelty, were daily food. Ah, what wonder
one lapses into barbarism! For the last half-dozen
years she had slaved, and sometimes gone
hungry. She could have strangled little Dan
when he came, for adding to her burthens. How
much of the peril of the soul depends upon the
surroundings!
</p>
<p>
And now Dil longed for the strong arms to be
about her. Do you wonder she had so little idea
of a heavenly Father? The teaching of the Mission
School had been measured by the hard, bare
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
materialism of poverty, quite as upas-like as the
materialism of philosophy. It had a rather dainty
aspect when John Travis dallied with it among
his college compeers; but it seems shocking
when these hundreds of little children cannot
even formulate the idea of a God. And though
Dil stretched out her hands with an imploring
moan, it was for some present and personal comfort.
</p>
<p>
Owny came creeping in softly, and just saved
his skin, for to-night his mother returned earlier
than usual. She was growing stout, and walked
solidly. She seemed to be puttering about. Then
she pushed Dil’s door wide open, and there was
barely room for her. The lamp stood on the floor
outside. Dil’s “chest of drawers” was covered
with a curtain of various pieces, and she had ornamented
the top with treasures found amid
the cast-off Christmas and Easter cards that had
fallen to her when more favored children had
tired of them. A cigar-box was covered with
some bits of silk, and held a few paltry “treasures.”
Some fancy beads, a tarnished bangle, a
bit of ribbon, and so on, she found as she dumped
them in her apron and then thrust them back.
Next she dragged the articles out of the improvised
“drawers,” and shook them one by one.
Nothing contraband fell out. There was nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
to reward her search, and she glared at the child
in the faded, shabby wagon.
</p>
<p>
Dil hardly breathed. She remembered in that
half-frozen, fascinated sort of way that horrible
events will rise up, ghost-like, in times of terror—that
one night last winter, a woman farther up
the court had murdered her two little children,
and then killed herself. She was cold with an
awful apprehension of evil. Even though she
kept her eyes closed, she could seem to see with
that awesome, inward sight.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn thrust her hand under Bess’s pillow,
under her bed, and the poor child gave a broken,
disturbed half-cry. Her efforts were fruitless; but
before Dil could give a sound to her horrible fear,
she had turned and was facing her. Then Dil
sprang partly up, but the scream curdled in her
throat.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, ye naydent disturb yersilf this time o’
night. I was jist lookin’ in upon me two gals that
the man was so distrissed about. Dil Quinn, av’
ye iver go to the bad like some gals, I’ll not lave
a square inch of skin on yer body, ner a whole bone
inside. I’ll have no men singin’ round whiles
I’m not here. You shut the door on ’em, jist.
You’re a humbly little runt, God knows, but thim
kind is purty hard whin they once set out. Ye
mind, now! An’ that un—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
She shook her fist, and backed out of the room,
for she could hardly have turned around. Bess
moaned, but she was not awake. Dil used all her
strength to suppress a scream, while a cold perspiration
oozed from every pore.
</p>
<p>
When she dared, after the lamp was out, she
rose and changed Bess to a more comfortable position.
Ah, if the book had been there! The child
shuddered with vague apprehension.
</p>
<p>
All the rest of the night she lay fearfully awake,
and the next morning she looked ghastly. Even
her mother was moved.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t look well, Dil,” she said. “What’s
got yer?”
</p>
<p>
“My head aches.” Had she dreamed that horrible
vision of the night?
</p>
<p>
“Take some queuann. Ye’ve no toime to be
sick. Ye spind too much toime over the brat
there. An’ it’ll be a mercy whin it’s all over. I
cuddent stan’ it mesilf much longer.”
</p>
<p>
Patsey came that afternoon. Business was good,
and he had a few dimes in the bank. He and three
other boys boarded with an old woman.
</p>
<p>
“But I’ve been thinkin’, Dil, that if we had you
instid o’ the old woman! She can’t make an Irish
stew worth shucks, an’ yers wud jist make a felly
sing in his sleep. Whin I git some money ahead
I’ll jist have youse come. Yer mammy’ll not mind
if ye take Bess.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>
</p>
<p>
Dil smiled. It was lovely of Patsey, but they
would be going to heaven then. She wondered
why they didn’t care to take Patsey along when
they were so fond of him. He wouldn’t want
to go—how she knew that she could not tell,
either.
</p>
<p>
He brought Bess a splendid orange and some
candy and an illustrated paper. The pictures
were very entertaining.
</p>
<p>
“Bess is lookin’ slim,” he said. “She wants to
go out in the fresh air.”
</p>
<p>
“But it’s so cold, an’ it just goes over me an’
all through, as if I hadn’t half enough clo’es on.
No, I must stay in an’ keep good an’ warm, an’
get well by spring.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the talk,” and Patsey smiled.
</p>
<p>
When he was gone and they were all alone, they
looked at each other curiously.
</p>
<p>
“’Twould be nice to go an’ live with Patsey if
we wasn’t goin’ to heaven,” Bess said. “I do be
so afeard of mammy sometimes.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ she rummiged last night, Bess, on the
shelves an’ in your bed; an’ if it hadn’t been for
yer wit she’d a found the book. I was so glad it
was in Misses Murphy’s, an’ I guess I’ll keep it
up there every night; an’ if she finds out an’ asts,
I’ll say an’ old trac’ woman left it. She won’t
mind an old woman. I sh’d hate to tell such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
lie, but when we see <em>him</em> we’ll tell him how it
was. ’Cause we can’t be murdered.”
</p>
<p>
“We just won’t tell any one ’bout goin’ to
heaven, either. Only Patsey, just at the last.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn dropped her suspicions in a few
days. The weather was growing colder, and she
needed a little more to keep up the internal fires.
She managed to pay her rent promptly, and so had
a good reputation with the agent. Through Dil’s
good management the boys fared very well as to
food, but Bess did not eat enough to keep a bird
alive.
</p>
<p>
“But the medicine helps,” she said. “It’s such
splendid medicine! so much better’n that ’Spensary
stuff.”
</p>
<p>
The morphine in it soothed and quieted. Sometimes
Bess slept all the morning, and now she was
seldom wakeful at night. Dil thought that an improvement.
If only she was not so frightfully
thin!
</p>
<p>
The days sped on with little variation. At
Thanksgiving they had two turkeys, and several
of Mrs. Quinn’s cronies came in to dinner. They
feasted all the rest of the week.
</p>
<p>
And now another month was gone. Only four
remained.
</p>
<p>
Alas! with all their care and caution, and the
ready sympathy of Mrs. Murphy, there came a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
swift, crushing martyrdom to their much-loved
Christiana, almost to Dil. She had hurried her
supper dishes out of the way, tidied up the room,
and, as her mother had gone to Mrs. MacBride’s,
Dan in bed with a cold, and Owen roaming the
streets, Dil brought out her book for an hour’s
reading. They had come to Giant Grim and his
blustering threats to the Pilgrims, who would have
fared badly indeed but for Mr. Greatheart. Dil
had to stop to spell many of the words; often it
took the united efforts of both brains to decide
the meaning of a sentence.
</p>
<p>
The door opened, and Mrs. Quinn walked in.
There had been a rather heated talk at Mrs.
MacBride’s.
</p>
<p>
Dil paused suddenly, with a swift, startled breath.
</p>
<p>
“What’s that ye got?” She came nearer and
glared over Dil. “An’ who gev ye that?”
</p>
<p>
“A—a woman left it!” exclaimed Dil tremulously.
“An old woman with trac’s—”
</p>
<p>
She pulled Dil up to her feet, and the book fell
to the floor.
</p>
<p>
“An’ it wasn’t that—that singin’ man?”
</p>
<p>
She shook her so that Dil could scarcely make
a sound, and for once she hardly minded.
</p>
<p>
“No man has been here,” declared Bess.
</p>
<p>
“Shet yer head!” roared her mother. “Pick
up that buke. What’s it all about?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
</p>
<p>
“’Bout a woman they told me of in the Mission
School. She took her children an’—was goin’ to
heaven—”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you’ve got business here, an’ ye’ll be
tindin’ to it, it’s my opinion. Ye ain’t got time
for no sich foolin’. Yer wurruk will kape ye
busy. Ye best not be settin’ up fer a schollard.
The radin’ an’ the stuff’ll turn your head upside
down. Take that!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn gave her a resounding blow with
it. Before Dil could fairly see, she had marched
over to the stove.
</p>
<p>
“O mother! mother!” shrieked Dil as she
caught her arm.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn gave her a push that sent her staggering
across the room. She raised the stove-lid,
and crowded in the book.
</p>
<p>
“Ye’ll not waste yer time over any sich nonsense.
Git off to bed at wanst, er I’ll make ye
see stars! Take that measlin’ brat along wid
ye.”
</p>
<p>
Dil turned the wagon into the small chamber
without another word. Bess caught her hands,
but neither dared speak.
</p>
<p>
“Where’s Owny?” the mother demanded.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” almost sobbed Dil.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll not hev him runnin’ the streets at night!
A foine sister yes are, to be sure, readin’ novils,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
an’ lettin’ yer pore brother go to destruction! If
ye don’t kape him in at night I’ll know the reason
why. I’ll lie here a bit, an’ I’ll give him a norful
larrupin’ when he comes.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn threw herself down on the old
lounge, and in five minutes was snoring as usual.
Dil prepared Bess for bed, and rubbed her with a
soft mitten she had made. The poor thing
trembled so that it was a positive shudder. Then,
as the snoring grew louder, they dared to give
vent to their own overcharged hearts in tears.
</p>
<p>
“An’ to think poor Christiana’s burnt up, an’
we can’t tell how she got out of the giant’s
hands! Dil, there’s jes’ such truly people, an’
mammy’s one of ’em! Jes’ think if she’d been
like Christiana, an’ took us by the hand, an’ was
leadin’ us to heaven, an’ pushin’ the kerrige whiles
to spell you!”
</p>
<p>
Then they cried again at the thought, so
utterly delightful, and the present reality so hard
to bear.
</p>
<p>
“But we know she <em>did</em> get to heaven,” resumed
Bess; “only we can’t tell how many things there
were. Dil, it isn’t reel easy to go to heaven,
after all. But when we have <em>him</em>, you see he’ll
do the fightin’, an’ he’ll pick out the way, an’
we’ll go right straight along. We won’t stop in
them queer places an’ get all tangled up; for we’re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
in such a norful hurry to get there, an’ have my
hurted legs made well.”
</p>
<p>
Dil kissed her convulsively, and cried over the
shining golden head. Besides the book, there had
been an irreparable loss to her, that Bess had not
yet realized. She had tucked her precious picture
inside the cover of the book. For now she felt it
must be kept out of her mother’s sight, as she
could not explain how she came by it, and escape
with her life. That, too, had perished in the
flames, the next precious thing to Bess.
</p>
<p>
The poor children unlocked arms presently, and
Dil crept into bed sad and forlorn. She heard
Owen stealing in, but her mother never stirred.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn sat taking her cup of coffee the
next morning when Owen made his appearance.
She tried to recall what had happened last night,
and whether she had thrashed him or not.
</p>
<p>
“A purty time of night it was for ye to come
home,” she began.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, come off!” said Owen. “What yer givin’
us? I was home an’ abed afore ye kem in, an’ ye
was full of the shindy at Mis’ MacBride’s. Don’t
ye remimber how ye wint on?”
</p>
<p>
Owen dodged the cuff. His mother was so
nonplussed that for once she was helplessly silent.
But as she went out of the door she turned and
said,—
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll see yer in to-night, young feller.”
</p>
<p>
Dil’s face was in such a maze of surprise that
she looked at Owen without being able to utter
a word for some moments, while he laughed
heartily.
</p>
<p>
“How could ye, Owny?”
</p>
<p>
“How cud I?” Owen laughed again. “Well,”
with a swagger, “it’s all in knowin’ how to dale
with the female sect. Was she thunderin’ mad
last night? Did she go fer me?”
</p>
<p>
“But about Mrs. MacBride? How could ye
know what happened?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, ye see I was passin’ jes’ after the shindy.
That Mrs. Whalen who made the row whin she
beat ye so, ye know, was harang’in’; an’ then I
heard there’d been a great row, an’ mammy’d
come home mad as a hornet. So, sez I, I’ll wait
until she’s asleep before I trust myself. An’ its
jes’ havin’ yer wits about ye. She was too drunk
to remember what she did. Did she break yer
head agen? If she did I’ll go an’ complain of
her. Whin yer tired a-havin’ her round, we’ll
git her sent up to th’ Island. An’ now get me
some grub.”
</p>
<p>
“She only struck me wunst. But she burnt up
something,” and Dil began to sob. “But, Owny,
ye were not in, an’ it was a—a—”
</p>
<p>
“Git off de stump wid yer high notions! I’d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
save me head wid any kind o’ lie. You gals don’t
know nothin’ but to run right agin de stun wall.
Ye see, it’s a bit o’ circumwention, an’ ye jes’ use
yer brains a bit to save yer skull er yer back.
But dat old gin-mill ain’t goin’ to boss me much
longer. Ye’ll see, an’ be moighty s’prised. An’
here’s a nickel, Dil.”
</p>
<p>
Owen ate his breakfast, and then taking out a
cigarette, lighted it, and swaggered off.
</p>
<p>
Dil woke Dan, and gave him his meal, as two
babies were asleep and the other sat on the floor
munching a crust.
</p>
<p>
Bess slept late. Poor Dil went about her work
in a strange maze. Owny slipped out of a great
many things, and told lies about them, and this
morning he had been very “cute.” Dil sighed.
She could not have done it. She would have
blundered and betrayed herself. And yet she had
told a lie about the book. It had not saved the
book, but perhaps it had saved her and Bess from
something more terrible.
</p>
<p>
It was a sad day for both of them. The babies
were cross. One had a bad cold and a croupy
sound in his voice. There was not even a glint
of sunshine at noon now; the high houses kept it
out of the court. But the day wore to an end.
Mrs. Quinn did not go out at all in the evening.
Owen was very jaunty, and pretended to study.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn’s reformation lasted two or three
days. She had “taken her oath she would niver
step fut inside o’ Mrs. MacBride’s dure;” but
Mrs. MacBride had no notion of losing so good
a customer. To be sure, Mrs. Quinn was getting
rather quarrelsome and overbearing, but she was
good company for the most part.
</p>
<p>
Winter had fairly set in with December.
There was much talk of dull times, and the babies
fell off after Monday and Tuesday. Owen and
his mother seemed continually on the warpath.
He was a big, stout boy of his age; and, when he
thought it was safe, played hookey, put in coal,
ran errands, sold papers, and did whatever his
hands found to do with all his might, even to
snivyin’ on the corner grocer. Dan was pretty
shrewd and sharp, though not so daring, but
could swear and smoke cigar ends with the worst
of them.
</p>
<p>
There was an occasional religious visitor in the
court besides the sisters and the priests. But
Dil never mentioned them to her mother now.
Besides, she did not want to leave Bess for even
an hour or two at the Mission School; she hated
to spend a moment away from her. Since the
loss of the book and the picture they clung closer
to each other. There was only one anticipation
now, waiting for spring and John Travis.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>
</p>
<p>
And as other things failed, their faith seemed
to centre about this. They lived on the hope of
heaven with the fervor of saints who had known
and loved the Lord, and were counting all the
appointed days, as if the glories had already been
revealed, and they were walking by faith.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>VIII—BESS</h2>
<p>
Everybody began to talk about Christmas.
Last year Dil had wheeled Bess around to see the
shop windows.
</p>
<p>
“If it would come reel nice and warm, an’ there
wasn’t any babies! But it’s awful cold when you
just have a winder open to sweep, an’ I couldn’t
stan’ bein’ out in it.”
</p>
<p>
“No, you couldn’t,” and Dil sighed.
</p>
<p>
Bess was ethereal now. Her large, bright eyes,
her golden hair, and the pink that came in her
cheeks every afternoon, gave a suggestion of the
picture. Then she was so curiously, so nervously
alive, that, afraid as Dil was of every change, she
blindly hoped some of these things were indications
of recovery.
</p>
<p>
But Dil’s poor head ached a good deal now, and
she had restless nights when it seemed as if she
would burn up. As she listened to Bess’s beautiful
thoughts and strange visions, she felt discouraged
with her own stupidness. She was so
physically worn out that her brain was inert.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
</p>
<p>
“I wisht I knew what Christmas was all about,”
sighed Bess. “An’ Santa Claus! Mammy says
there ain’t no such thing, an’ he couldn’t come
down a chimbly. But he gives a norful lot of
things to some folks. An’, Dil, we used to hang
up our stockings. What’s it for, anyway?”
</p>
<p>
Dil gave a long sigh, and the wrinkles of perplexity
deepened and strayed over her short nose.
</p>
<p>
“Johnny Dike’s goin’ to see the cradle in the
manger on Christmas Eve. An’ he’s goin’ to take
a present, some money he’s been savin’ up. What
makes Christ get born agen? ’Tain’t the Lord
Jesus, though; for he’s a big man now, if he can
carry children in his arms.”
</p>
<p>
“We might ast Johnny or Misses Murphy,”
suggested Dil.
</p>
<p>
“They’re Catholics. An’ there’s such curis
things, with people tellin’ you diff’rent. I don’t
see how he can be born every Christmas. I
b’lieve I like Santa Claus best. You don’t have
to give him nothin’ when you ain’t got even a
penny. O Dil,” pausing to rest a moment, “don’t
you wisht <em>he</em> was here! He’d know all about it.
Rich folks have chances, an’ get to know everything.
He’s a long way off. When mammy was
clever t’other night, I ast her ’bout comin’ crost
the oshin, ’Lantic Oshin, ’tis; an’ she said you
sailed an’ sailed two whole weeks. An’ if he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
don’t start ’till April, there’ll be two weeks more.
I keep countin’ thim up.”
</p>
<p>
Dil had been warming some broth.
</p>
<p>
“I wisht you’d take a little of this,” she said.
“The ’Spensary doctor said you must have it.
An’ you ain’t eat nothin’ but the pear an’ the
piece of norange.”
</p>
<p>
“They was so good and juicy. My throat’s
hot, an’ kinder dry an’ sore. Things don’t taste
good.”
</p>
<p>
“I wisht I could get some more of that nice
medicine. The ’Spensary stuff ain’t no good. I
might ast Patsey to lend me some money; but
how’d I ever get any to pay him back?”
</p>
<p>
They looked at each other in wonderment.
Then the child’s feverish eyes sparkled.
</p>
<p>
“O Dil, I know <em>he’d</em> help us pay it back, for
mammy was so cross to the lady he sent that she
won’t come no more. An’ ’twouldn’t been no use
to give mammy the money. O Dil, we’ve had ten
whole dollars. Wasn’t it lovely? An’ I wisht the
time would spin round an’ round, faster’n ever. I
get so tired waitin’. Seems sometimes ’s if I jes’
couldn’t draw another breath.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you must! you must!” cried Dil in
affright. “For when people stop breathin’, they
die.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ I wanter live, so’s we can get started
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
for heaven. I’ll be better when it’s all nice an’
warm out o’ doors, an’ sunshiny. I’d jes’ like to
live in sunshine. You see, when the babies cry, it
makes me feel all roughened up like. An’ I’m
that feared o’ mammy when she an’ Owny hev
scrimmiges. There’s a lump comes in my throat
’n’ chokes me. But I’m gonter live. Don’t you
know how las’ winter I was so poor an’ measlin’?
An’ I crawled out in the spring. Owny was
readin’ in his lesson ’bout some things doin’ that
way;” and Bess gave a pitiful ghost of a laugh.
</p>
<p>
“Won’t you lay me down?” she asked presently.
“My poor back’s so tired.”
</p>
<p>
“You must eat some broth first.”
</p>
<p>
She did not want it, and the effort she made to
please Dil was heroic.
</p>
<p>
She often asked to be laid down now. When
the babies cried, it seemed as if knives were being
thrust into her head. She had so many queer
fancies, but she tried not to tell the bad ones
to Dil. One moment she seemed out of doors,
with the cold rasping her skin everywhere, going
down her back like a stream of ice-water. Then
she was scorched with heat, her skin crisping up
and cracking. When she was pillowed up, it
seemed as if she would fall to pieces; when she
was laid down, the poor bones ached.
</p>
<p>
And in that land of “pure delight” there was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
no pain, no sickness, no chilling winds! And perhaps
the babies didn’t cry,—maybe there were no
babies. They mightn’t be big enough to go, and
they would be scared at the giants.
</p>
<p>
Monday night began badly. A neighbor came
in and made a complaint about Owen, and threatened
to have him arrested. He had broken a
pane of glass and kicked her dog. Mrs. Quinn
was tired with a big wash; and this made her
furious, though she went at the woman in no
gentle terms.
</p>
<p>
Owen had not been so much to blame. The
miserable little cur had snapped at him, and he
had kicked it away. Then, as it ran yelping along,
it was too good a mark for a boy to miss. He
shied a piece of oyster shell; but, as bad luck
would have it, he missed the dog, and the missile
bounded down to a basement window.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll put that lad in the ’form school this blissid
week! A pore woman can’t take care o’ sich a lot
o’ brats, an’ they fuller ’n an egg of diviltry. I’ll
jist see—”
</p>
<p>
She began to hunt around for the end of a stout
trunk-strap. Dil trembled in every limb. If Owny
would only stay away! But he didn’t. He came
up the stairs whistling gayly; for he had earned
a quarter, and he was saving money to have a
regular Christmas blow-out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
His mother fell on him. There was a tremendous
battle. Owen kicked and scratched and
swore, and his mother’s language was not over
choice. He managed to wriggle away, and reached
the door, crying out, as he sprang down the stairs,
that he’d “niver darken the dure agin, if he lived
a hundred years;” and added to it an imprecation
that made Dil turn faint and cold.
</p>
<p>
Bess went into a hysteric.
</p>
<p>
“Drat the young un! Shet yer head, er you’ll
get some, ye bag o’ bones! Ye shud a ben in yer
grave long ago. Take her in t’other room, Dil. I
can’t bide the sight uv her!”
</p>
<p>
Dil uttered not a word, though the room spun
round. She poured her mother a cup of tea, and
had a dish of nicely browned sausage, and some
baked potatoes. Mrs. Quinn ate, and threatened
dire things about Owny. Then she put on her
shawl, throwing it over her head, which meant an
hour or two or three at Mrs. MacBride’s, though
she started to look for Owen.
</p>
<p>
Dil brought the wagon back, and nursed and
soothed Bess.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t ever come back, if I was Owny,”
she said in her spasmodic tone, for the nervous
fright was still strong upon her. “An’ if I had
two good legs, we’d run away too. Dil, I think
she’d jes’ be glad to have me die.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
</p>
<p>
Dilsey Quinn shuddered. Just a few months
longer—
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Murphy came in to borrow a “bit o’ tay,”
and to learn what the rumpus was about. Dan
told the story, putting Owny in the best light, and
declaring valiantly that “Owny wasn’t no chump.”
</p>
<p>
“Misses Murphy,” said Dil, as soon as she could
get a chance, “what is it ’bout Christmas? an’
what makes Christ be born ivery year?”
</p>
<p>
“Shure, dear, I do be havin’ so many worries
that I disremember. What wid th’ babby bein’
sick, an’ pore ol’ Mis’ Bolan not sittin’ up a minnit,
an’ bein’ queer like in her mind, an’ me hardly
airnin’ enough to keep body an’ sowl togither, I
hardly mind ’bout the blissed day. But I do be
thinkin’ he isn’t born reely, for ye see the blissid
Virgin’s his mother, an’ she’s in hivin wid th’
saints. I do be a bad hand at tellin’ things
straight; but I niver had any larnin’, fer I wint in
a mill whin I was turned o’ six years. An’ whin
ye can’t rade, it’s hard gettin’ to know much. But
I’ll ast the praist. Ah, dear,” with a furtive
glance at Dil, “If ye’d only let me ast him to
come—”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no, no!” protested Dil. “Mother’d kill
us; an’ she don’t b’leve in priests an’ such. You
know how she went on ’bout the man who came
an’ sang.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
</p>
<p>
“Ah, yis, dear; it wouldn’t do.” And she shook
her head, her eyes still fixed sorrowfully on Bess.
“But I have me beads, an’ I go to confission
wanst a month, an’ that’ll be Friday now, an’ I’ll
ast Father Maginn an’ tell ye all. Oh, you poor
childer! An’ it’ll be a sad Christmas fer many a
wan, I’m thinkin’. There’s poor Mis’ Bolan—”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Murphy paused. Was Dil so blind? She
could not suggest Mrs. Bolan’s death when the
great shadow seemed so near them.
</p>
<p>
“Dear,” she added, with sympathetic softness,
“if ye should be wantin’ any one suddint like,
run up fer me.”
</p>
<p>
“Yer very kind, Misses Murphy. I sometimes
wisht there would be nights a whole week long,
I’m so tired.”
</p>
<p>
Owen did not come home that night nor the
next. Dil devoutly hoped he would not come at
all. She had a secret feeling that he would go
to Patsey, and she comforted Bess with it. The
house was so much quieter, and Dan was better
alone.
</p>
<p>
Even in Barker’s Court there were people who
believed in Christmas, though some of them had
ideas quite as vague as Dilsey Quinn’s. But there
was a stir in the very air, and penny trumpets
began to abound. Still, there were many who
had no time for Christmas anticipations, who were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
driven to do their six days’ work in five, who
stitched from morning to midnight, who did not
even have time to gossip with a neighbor.
</p>
<p>
Poor Bess! she could not eat, and she was so
restless. The pears and the oranges were gone,
and, saddest of all, their bank was empty. If
Patsey would only come!
</p>
<p>
Dil took Bess up and laid her down, gave her
sips of water, caressed her tenderly, bathed her
head with cologne, and even that was running
low. The babies were left on the floor to cry, if
Dil caught the faintest sound that was like desire.
Bess often just held up her spindling arms and,
drawing Dil down, kissed her with eager fervor.
</p>
<p>
She was so glad to have night come and see
the last baby taken away. Mrs. Quinn was working
at a grand house where they were to have a
Christmas feast. She was to go again to-morrow;
and, as it was late, she did not go out, but just
tumbled into bed, with not an anxiety on her
mind.
</p>
<p>
Dil sat and crooned to her little sister, who
seemed a part of her very life. When Mrs.
Quinn snored, it was safe to indulge in a little
freedom. And though Dil was so worn and
weary, she ministered as only love can. Everybody
had been so used to Bess’s weakness, and
they thought that the end would be a great relief.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
But Dil never dreamed of the end they saw so
plainly.
</p>
<p>
It was past midnight when Dil laid her down
for the last time.
</p>
<p>
“O Dil, I feel so nice an’ easy all of a suddent,”
she cried, with an eager joyousness that
thrilled the heavy heart. “Nothin’ pains me.
I’m quite sure I’ll be better to-morrow. An’
when Patsey comes, we’ll just ast him to help
us get that nice medicine. He’s so good to us,
Dil; ’n’ if he had lots of money he’d give us
anything.”
</p>
<p>
“He just would,” said Dil. “An’ if Owny’s
gone to him, he’ll be all right.”
</p>
<p>
The thought comforted her immeasurably.
</p>
<p>
“O Dil, dear,” murmured the plaintive voice,
“do you remember the big bowl of wild roses,
an’ how sweet they were, an’ how pritty, with
their soft pink leaves an’ baby buds? I can
almost smell them. It’s so sweet all around.
Dil, <em>are</em> there any wild roses?”
</p>
<p>
“No, dear,” said the gentle, tired voice.
</p>
<p>
“Well—then I’m dreamin’; an’ they’re so
lovely. Just like <em>he</em> told us, you know; ’bout
that place where they growed. Oh, you dear,
sweet, lovely Dil! I want to see the picture he
put you in. You were pritty, I know; folks
always are pritty in pictures. An’ we’ll ast him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
to let us be taken over agen, for when we get on
the way to heaven we’ll both be so full of joy.
An’ he’ll help us clear to the pallis.”
</p>
<p>
She stopped to breathe. It came so quick and
short now, hardly going below her chest.
</p>
<p>
“Sit here an’ hold my two hands. Dil, dear,
I’m as much trouble as the babies; but I most
know I’ll be better to-morrow. And when I go
fast asleep, you run right to bed, an’ it’ll be all
right. I feel so light an’ lovely, ’most ’s if I was
a wild rose—a soft, pink, satiny wild rose.”
</p>
<p>
There was a little pleasant gurgle that did duty
for a laugh. Dil kissed her and crooned sleepily.
As she held the hands, the fever seemed to go
out of them. The little golden head had such a
restful poise. The breath came slowly, easily.
</p>
<p>
Dil kissed her with the long, yearning, passionate
kisses that take one’s whole soul, that leave
some souls bankrupt indeed. All her own being
was in a strange quiver. Oh, did it mean that
Bess would be better to-morrow? She believed it
in some strange, undefined way, and was at peace.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps she drowsed. She started, feeling
stiff and chilly. Bess slept tranquilly. There
was no pain to make her moan unconsciously.
Why, it was almost a foretaste of that blessed
land.
</p>
<p>
Dil wrapped herself in an old shawl and dropped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
down on her little cot. In all the glad wide world
there was no one to come in and comfort her, and
so God sent his angel—kindly sleep. The night
breath that he breathed over her had the fragrance
of wild roses.
</p>
<p>
The alarm clock roused her. It was dark now
when her day began. Bess was quiet; and she
drew the blanket more closely around her, for the
morning felt bitterly cold. She stirred the fire,
made her mother’s coffee, and broiled a bit of
steak. The windows were all ice, which seldom
happened.
</p>
<p>
“It’s enough to kill one to go out in the cold,”
declared Mrs. Quinn. “I’ll not be home airly the
night, for I promised cook to stay a bit an’ gev
her a hand wid th’ fancy fixin’s. Foine doin’s
they’re to be havin’. An’ if that thafe of the
world Owny comes in, ye be soft spoken jist as if
nothin’ had happened. I’ll settle wid him. I’ll
gev him some Christmas!”
</p>
<p>
With that she was off. Then Dan came for
his breakfast.
</p>
<p>
“I do miss Owny so,” he half whimpered.
“Ther’ ain’t a boy in the street who could think
up such roarin’ fun.”
</p>
<p>
“Whisht!” Dil said softly. “Bess is asleep,
an’ I won’t have her worrited. She had a bad
time yist’day with the babies. I do hope there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
won’t be no such crowd to-day. Seven babies
an’ that was thirty-five cents. Mother might be
given Bess an’ me some Christmas.”
</p>
<p>
Dan laughed at that.
</p>
<p>
Dil sighed. She drank a little coffee, but she
could not eat. Two sleepy babies came. She
washed the dishes, and spread up her mother’s
bed, putting the babies in there. It was dark,
with no ventilation but the door, and kept warm
easily.
</p>
<p>
Another and another baby, one crying for its
mother. When Dil had hushed it she took a
vague glance at Bess, whose fair head lay there so
restful. The frost was melting off the window-panes,
and she put out the lamp. With a baby in
her arms she sat down and rocked.
</p>
<p>
A curious sense of something, not quite anxiety,
came over her presently. She went to Bess
and raised the blanket, peering at the small white
face that seemed almost to light the obscurity of
the room. The eyes were half-closed. The lips
were parted with a smile, and the little white
teeth just showed. One hand seemed to hold
up the chin.
</p>
<p>
Dil stooped and kissed her. O God! what was
it? What was it? For Bess was marble cold.
</p>
<p>
“O Bess, Bess!” she cried in mortal terror.
“Wake up, my darlin’! Wake up an’ get warm.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
As she seized the hand, a startling change came
over the child. The chin dropped. The pretty
smile was gone. The eyes looked out with awesome
fixedness. Her heart stood still as if she
were frozen.
</p>
<p>
Then, moved by horror, she flew up-stairs, her
breath almost strangling her.
</p>
<p>
“O Misses Murphy!” she shrieked, “there’s
somethin’ strange come over Bess. She’s never
been like this—an’ cold—”
</p>
<p>
“Yis, dear. I’ll jist look at poor Mis’ Bolan.
She do be goin’ very fast. All night she was that
res’les’ talkin’ of the beautiful hymn the man
sung, an’ beggin’ him to sing it agen; an’ then
hearin’ angels an’ talkin’ ’bout green fields an’
flowers, an’ where there do be no night. They
do be mostly so at the last, rememberin’ beautiful
things.”
</p>
<p>
An awful terror clutched Dil at the heart, as
she recalled Bess’s talk of the wild roses. So
cruel a fear smote her that her very tongue
seemed paralyzed.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean”—she cried wildly.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Murphy’s thoughts were running on Mrs.
Bolan.
</p>
<p>
“She’ll not last the day through. Pore dear,
there’s not much pleasure to the’r ould lives. But
she did be so longin’ to have that man come
agen—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
</p>
<p>
She had taken Dil’s hand, and they were going
down-stairs. A baby had rolled off the lounge
and bumped his head, and was screaming. But
Dil hardly heard him. They went through to the
tiny room.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, pore dear! Pore lamb! She’s gone, an’
she’s outen all her mis’ry. She’ll niver suffer any
more. An’ she’s safe—”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Murphy paused, not quite sure she could
give that comfort. There was purgatory, and the
poor thing had never been christened. She was
extremely ignorant of her own church doctrine;
but she felt the bitter injustice of condemning
this poor soul to everlasting torment for her
mother’s neglect.
</p>
<p>
“No, Misses Murphy,” cried Dil in the accent
of utter disbelief, “she can’t be—Oh, hurry
an’ do somethin’ for her. She’s jes fainted! Le’s
get her warm agen. Bring her out to the fire,
an’ I’ll run for the ’Spensary doctor. Oh, no, she
isn’t—she wouldn’t—’cause we was goin’ to
heaven together in the spring, an’ she couldn’t
leave me without a word—don’t you see?”
</p>
<p>
Oh, the wild, imploring eyes that pierced Mrs.
Murphy through! the heart-breaking eyes that
entreated vainly, refusing the one unalterable
fiat!
</p>
<p>
“Ah, dear, they’sen don’t hev any ch’ice. O
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
Dil, Dilly Quinn!” and she clasped the child to
her heart. “You mustn’t take on so, dear!
Shure, God knows best. Mebbe he’s better’n
folks an’ the things they say. She won’t suffer
any more, pore dear. I’ve seen it for weeks, an’
knowed what must come.”
</p>
<p>
Dil gave a few long, dry, terrible sobs; then she
lay helpless in Mrs. Murphy’s arms. The kind
soul placed her on the cot, sprinkled water on
her face, chafed her hands; but Dil lay as one
dead.
</p>
<p>
Then she ran down-stairs.
</p>
<p>
“O Mrs. Minch! have ye iver a bit of camphire?
I used the last o’ mine this mornin’ for
the pore old craythur. Bessy Quinn’s gone at
last, an’ is cold, an’ Dil’s that overcome she’s gone
in an norful faint. Come up a bit, do. An’ that
haythen woman’ll not care more’n if it was a
kitten. She do be the hardest!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Minch laid down her work, looked up the
“camphire,” and plied her caller with inquiries.
</p>
<p>
All their efforts were unavailing, though Dil
opened her eyes once, and at intervals a shudder
ran through her frame.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, the poor dear’s dead and cold, and it’s
God’s mercy, Mrs. Murphy. How she’s lived so
long’s a mystery; but Dil’s been more watchful
than most any mother. She was the sweetest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
and patientest, and loved her beyond all things.
Mrs. Quinn hasn’t any human feeling in her, and
there’s plenty like her, more’s the shame. When
you bring helpless little ones in the world, it’s not
their fault. And when they are bruised and
banged and made helpless, as that poor little one,
a mother’s heart should have pitied her.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, dear, it’s the rum that takes out all the
nateral feelin’. An’ one ’ud think she’d had
enough of it in her husband, not to be goin’ the
same way. An’ pore Dil carin’ for them babies
an’ doin’ a woman’s work, a-stuntin’ her an’ makin’
her old afore her time. An’, if ye’ll stay, I’ll
go fer th’ ’Spensary doctor. Sorra a Christmas
it’ll be in the court. Mr. Sheehan is dyin’, an’
Mrs. Neefus’s baby went yes’tday, an’ the ould
woman—but they do be dyin’ all the time, some
wan.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Minch bent over Dil with pitying eyes.
She had seen better times, and lived in a nicer
neighborhood than Barker’s Court. But poverty
had driven her down step by step. She had her
old deaf father to care for, and a son growing up;
and the three rooms, such as they were, proved
cheaper than anything she had seen, though she
was on the lookout all the time. She had not
made much intimacy with her neighbors, except
that through her pity for Mrs. Bolan she had come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
to know good-hearted Mrs. Murphy quite well,
and she had been interested in Dilsey and Bess.
But most of the people in the court were afraid
of Mrs. Quinn’s tongue.
</p>
<p>
“The poor thing!” she sighed. “She is a little
old woman already. She has never had leave to
grow as children should. Oh, why are they
brought into the world to suffer?”
</p>
<p>
She had once thought herself full of trust and
love to God, but so many questions had come to
the surface with her years of hard experience.
Why this little Bess should have suffered four
years—but both parents had given her a good
constitution, that in some positions in life might
have made her a useful factor instead of mere
waste material.
</p>
<p>
Then she took up one of the crying babies.
Another was clamoring loudly, “Bed, bed,” and
opening wide his mouth to show her how empty
it was.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, how ever did she look after them all?”
she cried in despair as Mrs. Murphy entered.
</p>
<p>
“She had a rare way with childers, that she
had.” Mrs. Murphy cut a chunk from the loaf of
bread and gave the hungry baby. “An’ the docthor
will be in as soon as he kin, but there’s
a sight o’ folks waitin’. I have heerd say a
grane Christmas made fat graveyards, but this is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
cold enough to be black. An’ how’s the poor
gurl?”
</p>
<p>
“She seems—asleep somehow, and you can
notice her breathin’.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll look after Mrs. Bolan, an’ kem down agen,”
said Mrs. Murphy, disappearing.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>IX—DILSEY</h2>
<p>
Mrs. Bolan was faintly breathing, as she had
been since midnight, but so cold that she might
easily be thought dead. Mrs. Murphy’s baby was
asleep.
</p>
<p>
The babies were crowing and talking in their
fashion, unmindful of sorrow.
</p>
<p>
“The pore dear,” said Mrs. Murphy tenderly,
viewing Bess; “I’m thinkin’ we better care for
her afore Dil wakes up. An’ she never havin’
had a bit o’ christenin’, along o’ Mrs. Quinn not
belevin’ nothin’. I’ve heard her talk a way that
wud set yer blood a-chill.”
</p>
<p>
“The Lord took the little ones in his arms and
said, ‘Forbid them not,’ and I guess he won’t
mind the christenin’. And this child’s been patient
and cheerful beyond common. I think she’s
had a lot of Christian grace unbeknownst. She’d
look up with her sweet smile that almost broke
your heart, when Dil would be takin’ her out.
And how she stood everything—”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Quinn’s been not so savage as she used.
’Tain’t nat’rel for mothers to be so cruel. But
’twas last March, if I don’t disremember—you
were not here then, Mrs. Minch—she made such
a nawful ’ruction that the neighbors called in de
cop, and nothin’ but her beggin’ off an’ sayin’ the
children wud starve, an’ promisin’ on her bended
knees, which she never uses fer a bit o’ prayer,
saved her. An’ she don’t bang ’em about quite
so bad since.”
</p>
<p>
“There was an awful time the other night.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; that Owny’s too smart, an’ mebbe he
would er banged her in a fair fight; but he cut
stick, an’ hasn’t shown hide ner hair sence.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Murphy leaned over Dil, and uttered a
benison in her ignorant Christianity.
</p>
<p>
“’Pears like they jist oughten to go togither.
She looks like a ghost, poor thing.” Then she
lifted Bess from the shabby wagon that had been
her home so long, and brought her out on the
lounge.
</p>
<p>
“Will ye look at them poor legs?” she said
with a cry. “They do make yer heart bleed.
She was a smart little thing, goin’ to school, whin
it happened. The father oughter been hung fer
it; fer it was he that did it, murderin’ by inches.
An’ he beat Mrs. Quinn to a jelly. Wudden’t ye
think now she’d had enough o’ rum, not to be
goin’ the same road?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Minch sighed.
</p>
<p>
“It’s stuck everywhere, right in a body’s way,
Mrs. Murphy. They’re taxin’ people for prisons
and ’sylums and homes for orphans, when they
haven’t the sense to shut up the saloons and gin-mills.
Look at that Mrs. MacBride, smilin’ and
making it pleasant for a hard-workin’ woman, havin’
a nice warm room for gossipin’ and such, and bein’
clever enough to make them run up a score, and
get her money once a week. There’s no dancin’
nor carousin’; but it takes in the decentish sort of
women, and turns ’em out as bad as the men. It’s
the poor families that’s pinched and starved and
set crazy. When I think of my boy growin’ up in
it—but where’ll poor folks go? Saloons are all
over. They fight for the chance to ruin folks.”
</p>
<p>
“Thrue for ye, Mrs. Minch. An’ sorra indade
it is whin ye do be sad that they come into the
world, an’ rej’ice whin they go out of it young.
They’re spared a dale o’ pain an’ care. Yet it do
seem wrong some way. Childers should be a
blessin’ an’ comfort to yer ould age. Things is
changed in the world. One gits that confused
with thinkin’—”
</p>
<p>
They had prepared some water, but the poor
little body was clean and sweet. It was heart-breaking
to see it.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Murphy went into the bedroom for some
clothing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
</p>
<p>
“Will ye look at the sort o’ bury Dil made out o’
boxes an’ covered. She’s that handy an’ full o’ wit.
An’ them clo’es is like snow, and all mended nate.
I don’t see how she cud do it wid all the babies.
An’ I do be thinkin’ it was Dil’s love that kep’ the
little wan alive so long. It was like medicine;
her warm arms an’ cheery smile, her patience an’
thinkin’ what wud pleasure Bess. If there don’t
be a straight road to hiven fer thim both—an’
purgatory ought to be saved fer the ither kind.
Now, it don’t look a bit sinsible that little lamb
shud suffer whin she’s suffered so much a’ready!
Sometimes I most think the church has mistook
whin they save the rumsellers an’ the great
wicked men wid their money, cause they kin pay
fer prayers.”
</p>
<p>
“She’s in heaven, if there is any heaven.”
Sometimes Mrs. Minch doubted.
</p>
<p>
“An’ oh, Mrs. Minch, if there wasn’t any hiven
to rest us at last, how cud we live through the
cruel world?”
</p>
<p>
Such a pathetic cry as it was!
</p>
<p>
The doctor came. He looked at Bess, and asked
a few questions, made a note or two in his book,
cutting short Mrs. Murphy’s explanations.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, yes; I’ve seen the child. She’s been
strung on fine steel wires, or they’d given way
long ago. And the old woman? Strange how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
they go on living when they had a hundred times
better be dead, and the people of some account
go out like the snuff of a candle! Where’s the
girl?” glancing around.
</p>
<p>
“In there.” Mrs. Murphy nodded towards the
room.
</p>
<p>
Dil lay motionless, but for the faint breathing.
The doctor listened with his ear down on her
heart, felt her pulse, and seemed in a study.
</p>
<p>
“Let her sleep as long as she can. She has
worn herself out. She used to wheel this one
round,” nodding. “Have in some fresh air; the
room is stifling. How any one lives—”
</p>
<p>
Dil roused without opening her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Was it you, Bess? Oh, <em>is</em> it morning?”
</p>
<p>
“No, no; go to sleep again. The night’s just
begun. She’s dead tired out,” to the women.
“Let the mother come round when she can, and
get rid of these young ones before the girl
wakes. If there’s anything else wanted, send
round. Are these people very poor?”
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Quinn goes out washing. And the
babies are taken in by the day. I don’t know”—doubtfully.
</p>
<p>
“The mother will settle that. And the old
lady—the city must bury her, I suppose?”
</p>
<p>
“’Deed an’ it must. She’s had nothin’ but her
pinshin, an’ has no folk.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
</p>
<p>
They found Bess’s nice white frock pinned up
in a cloth, beautifully ironed and laid away in
anticipation of the journey—the very journey
she had taken so unknowingly. They put it on,
and smoothed down the poor little legs with tender
hands. Then they laid her on her mother’s
bed until Dil should rouse.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Minch brought up her sewing, while Mrs.
Murphy went to her own room to look after
Mrs. Bolan. Mrs. Carr, another neighbor, came
in and helped with the babies, and wondered how
Dilly Quinn had ever been able to do as much
work as a hearty, grown woman, and she not
bigger than a ten-year-old child!
</p>
<p>
It was three o’clock when Dil roused. Mrs.
Minch sat quietly at her sewing. The wagon was
pushed clear up to the window, empty.
</p>
<p>
“O Mrs. Minch, what has happened?” She
sprang out, wild-eyed and quivering.
</p>
<p>
“My dear,” Mrs. Minch took her in her arms,
“Bess is better off. She is in heaven with the
good God, who will be tenderer of her than any
human friend. She will have no more pain. She
will be well and strong, and a lovely angel. You
would not wish her back—”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I do, I do. We was goin’ to heaven
together in the spring; we had it all planned.
And Bess wouldn’t ’a’ gone without me—oh, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
know she wouldn’t. Where is she? What have
you done with her?”
</p>
<p>
“She is in there.”
</p>
<p>
Dil flew to her mother’s room. The ironing-board
lay on the bed, and a strange, still shape
imperfectly outlined under the sheet.
</p>
<p>
“She looks like an angel,” said Mrs. Minch.
</p>
<p>
Dilsey Quinn stared, bereft of her senses for
some moments. Slowly the incidents of the
morning came over her—of last night, when
Bess seemed so improved, so hopeful. She had
seen dead people. Death was no stranger in
Barker’s Court. There were “wakes,” and quiet,
hurried burials. They died and were taken away,
that was all. With a curious, obstinate unreason
she knew Bess had died like all the rest; yet she
had been so sure Bess could not die. But she had
<em>not</em> gone to heaven. The breath had gone out of
her body, but a breath couldn’t go to heaven.
She had left her body here; the poor hurted legs
the Lord Jesus would have mended. They could
never be mended now, for they would be put in
the ground.
</p>
<p>
She stood so still that Mrs. Minch raised the
sheet. The pinched look was going out of the
face, as it often does after death. The eyes were
closed; the long bronze lashes were beautiful;
the thin lips had been pressed rather tightly, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
if in fear that they might betray their secret.
Yet it had a strange, serene beauty.
</p>
<p>
Dil did not cry or utter a sound. A great solitude
enveloped her, as if she were alone in a
wide desert. She would never have any one to
love or caress; a thick darkness settled all about
her, as if now she and Bess were shut out of
heaven forever. For what would the palace be,
and the angels innumerable, if Bess was not
there?
</p>
<p>
She turned and went to her own room, began
to pick up the things and tidy it, spread the cot,
shook the cushion of the poor dilapidated wagon,
carefully laid over it the blanket she had taken
so much pains to make.
</p>
<p>
“Mrs. Minch,” she said, “will you please bring
Bess in here. Mammy wouldn’t like her there.
An’ I want her here—on my bed.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Minch looked at her in surprise. The
face was rigid and unresponsive, but there was
an awesome, chilling sorrow in every line. She
reverently obeyed Dil’s behest.
</p>
<p>
“You are very good. You see, no one cared
’bout her but jes’ me an’ Patsey an’”—Ah,
what <em>would</em> John Travis say? “An’ I want to
keep her here.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear, dear child—”
</p>
<p>
She put away the kindly hands, not ungently,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
but as if she could not quite bear them—as if she
was too sore for any human touch.
</p>
<p>
“How did I come to sleep so long?” she asked,
in a strained, weary tone.
</p>
<p>
“You were so tired, poor dear. The doctor
was in, and he said it was the best thing for you.
Mrs. Murphy has been in and out, and Mrs.
Carr.”
</p>
<p>
“You took care of the babies?” Her lips
quivered, and a few big tears rolled down her
cheeks. She could suffer, if the time to sorrow
had not yet come.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear. I don’t see how you get along so
with them. And do you feel better?”
</p>
<p>
The kind eyes studied her with concern.
</p>
<p>
“I’m well. I never do get sick.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you know where your mother is?”
</p>
<p>
“Not the street. No, ma’am. The people
have a queer long name. An’ she’ll be late th’
night.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Murphy looked in the door.
</p>
<p>
“Ah, yer up, an’ ye do look better. Hev ye
had anything to ate? Do ye mind if I have Mrs.
Minch come up-stairs just a bit?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no.” Dil did not notice the strain in the
eyes, the awesomeness of facing death.
</p>
<p>
“I cudden’t be alone. She’s roused, but she’s
almost gone; fightin’ fer life, one may say, at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
the very end,” she whispered as they went up
the stairs.
</p>
<p>
The babies were amusing themselves. Dil uncovered
the face of her dead, and looked long and
earnestly, as if she knew there was a great mystery
she ought to solve. Ah, how sweet she was!
Dil’s heart swelled with a sense of triumph. She
had always been so proud of Bess’s beauty.
</p>
<p>
But what was <em>dead?</em> It happened any time,
and to anybody, to babies mostly, and made you
cold and still, useless. Then you were taken
away and buried. It was altogether different
from going to heaven. What strange power had
taken Bess, and kept her from that blessed journey?
Why did the Lord Jesus let any one do
it? John Travis couldn’t have been so mistaken,
and Christiana, and the children.
</p>
<p>
She was so glad they had put on her best
dress, bought with John Travis’s money. Ah, if
they only had started that day and risked all!
Here was her blue sash and the blue bows for
her sleeves. She hardly had the courage to
touch the beloved form.
</p>
<p>
How strangely cold the little hands were. She
kissed them, and then she no longer felt afraid.
She raised the frail figure, and passed the ribbon
round the waist. Almost it seemed as if Bess
breathed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
</p>
<p>
She brought the brush and comb, and curled
the hair in her own flowing fashion, picking out
the pretty bang in rings, kissing the cold cheeks,
the shell-like eyelids. Why, surely Bess was only
asleep. She must, she would waken, to-morrow
morning perhaps. A sudden buoyant hope electrified
her. She had her again, and the horrible
thought of separation vanished. Dil was too
ignorant to formulate any theories, but every
pulse stirred within her own body.
</p>
<p>
Two of the mothers came for babies, but she
uttered no word of what had happened. Then
she fed the others, and fixed the fire, and Dan
peered in fearfully. She gave him a slice of
bread, and he was glad to be off.
</p>
<p>
Up-stairs they had watched the breath go out
of the poor body.
</p>
<p>
“Pore thing! God rist her sowl wheriver it
is,” and Mrs. Murphy crossed herself.
</p>
<p>
“Has she no friends?”
</p>
<p>
“Not a wan, I belayve. She used to talk of
some nevys whin she first come, that’s nigh two
years ago. But she’d lost track of them. I’m
sure I’ve taken good care of the pore ould craythur,
an’ I hope some wan will do the same to
me at the last.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re a kindly woman, Mrs. Murphy, and
God grant it. We don’t know where nor when
the end will come.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Minch stopped as she went down-stairs.
</p>
<p>
“Poor old Mrs. Bolan has gone to the better
land. She and Bess will have a Christmas with
the angels. They will not want to come back
here.”
</p>
<p>
Dil had no courage to argue. But she knew
to the very farthest fibre of her being, that nothing
could so change Bess that she would desire
to stay anywhere without her.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Garrick had heard the tidings before she
came in for her baby, and was profuse in her
sympathies.
</p>
<p>
“But it’s the Lord’s mercy, for she were a poor
sufferer, and was jist waitin’. How did it happen?
Was it in the night, whilst ye were all
asleep? An’ to think yer poor mother whint
away knowin’ nothin’.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t talk about it. I—I don’t know.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ old Mis’ Bolan. Well, I’ll run up-stairs a
bit, an’ see Mrs. Murphy.”
</p>
<p>
She was rewarded for her trouble here; the
strange curiosity of some, as if the dead face
could answer the mystery.
</p>
<p>
“She’s a moighty quare girl, that Dilsey Quinn.
Niver to be askin’ one to look at the corpse; an’
if Bess hadn’t been so peaked, she would have
been a pritty child. She had such iligant hair.”
</p>
<p>
The neighbors began to make calls of condolence. Two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
deaths in a house was an event
rather out of the common order of things.
</p>
<p>
Dil awed them by her quiet demeanor, and
answered apathetically, busying herself with the
supper.
</p>
<p>
“What hev ye done wid her?” asked one.
“Shure, she’s not bin tuk away?”
</p>
<p>
“No; she’s in ther’, in my room. An’—an’
she’s mine.”
</p>
<p>
For to Dil there seemed something sacred about
Bess, and she kept guard rigorously. It was not
simply a dead body to gloat over. They could go
up-stairs and look at Mrs. Bolan.
</p>
<p>
It was nine o’clock when her mother came home
laden with budgets, and Dan following in a vaguely
frightened manner. He had been hanging about
Mrs. MacBride’s, waiting for her. She had gone
in and taken her “sup o’ gin,” and heard the
news, also the complaints.
</p>
<p>
“Whiniver did it happen, Dil?” throwing down
her budgets. “She’s been no good to hersilf nor
no wan else this long while. An’ she cudden’t
iver git well, an’ was a sight o’ trouble. But I’m
clear beat. Week after week I thought she’d be
sure to go, but when you’re lookin’, the thing
niver comes. An’ it’s took me so suddent like,
that I had no breath left at all. Was it true—did
ye find her dead, an’ faint clear away?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
She looked rather admiringly at Dil.
</p>
<p>
“Yes—she were cold,” said Dil briefly. “An’
then I don’t know what happened.”
</p>
<p>
“Ye pore colleen! Ye’ll be better widout her,
an’ ye’ll be gittin well an’ strong agin. It’s bin a
hard thing, an’ yer divil of a father shud a had
his own back broke. But he’s fast enough, and
I hope they’ll kape him there. Any word of
Owny?”
</p>
<p>
“No.” Oh, what would Owny say—an’ Patsey.
</p>
<p>
“Who kem an’ streeked her? Let’s see.”
</p>
<p>
She took the lamp and went in. It seemed to
Dil as if she would even now shake her fist at Bess,
and the child stood with bated breath.
</p>
<p>
“She were a purty little thing, Dil,” the mother
said with a softened inflection. “Me sister Morna
had yellow hair an’ purplish eyes, and was that
fair an’ sweet, but timid like. I believe me
mother had some such hair, but the rest of us
had black. She looks raile purty, an’ makes a
better corpse than I iver thought. Why didn’t
ye lit thim see her, Dil? Ye’s needn’t a been
shamed of her.”
</p>
<p>
Dil was saved from answering by the advent of
a throng of neighbors. The room seemed so
warm, and there was such a flurry, she dropped on
the lounge faint and breathless.
</p>
<p>
“Go to bed, Dan,” said his mother.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
</p>
<p>
Dil rose again and opened the door. The cold
air, close and vile as it was, felt grateful.
</p>
<p>
“Go up-stairs a bit in Mrs. Murphy’s;” and
though the permission was a command, Dil went
gratefully.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Murphy sat sewing to make up for lost
time. Her little girl was asleep in the cradle.
She had improved since cooler weather had set
in. The door of one room was shut. The old
chintz-covered Boston rocker was empty.
</p>
<p>
“I couldn’t stay to see them all lookin’ at her,”
she exclaimed tremulously, as she almost tottered
across the room.
</p>
<p>
“No, dear.” Mrs. Murphy took her in her
arms. “Ye look like a ghost. But Bess is main
pritty, an’ it’s a custom. Will ye sit here?”
</p>
<p>
Dil shuddered as she looked at the empty chair
where Mrs. Bolan used to sit.
</p>
<p>
“No; I’ll take the stool. I just want to be a
bit still like an’ think. I couldn’t talk ’bout <em>her</em>,
you know.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear,” with kindly sympathy.
</p>
<p>
Dil dropped on a box stool, leaning her folded
arms on a chair. Mrs. Murphy took up her sewing
again. She longed to comfort, but she was
sore afraid the two lorn souls were wandering
about purgatory. She had a little money of Mrs.
Bolan’s that she meant to spend in masses. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
who would pay for a mass for Bessy Quinn’s soul?
And she had never been baptized. The ignorant,
kindly woman was sore distressed.
</p>
<p>
Dil seemed to look through the floor and see
the picture down-stairs. All her sense of possession
rose in bitter revolt. Yet now she was helpless
to establish her supreme right. Her mother
had grudged Bess the frail, feeble spark of life;
she alone had cared for her, loved her, protected
her, and she was shut out, sent away. Now that
Bess needed no care and lay there quiet, they
could come and pity her.
</p>
<p>
Presently more tranquil thoughts came. Even
her mother could not do anything to hurt Bess.
She was safe at last.
</p>
<p>
There had been so much repression and self-control
in Dil’s short life, that it made her seem
apathetic now. And yet, slowly as the poor pulses
beat, there was a strange inward fire and stir, as
if she must do something. A curious elusiveness
shrouded the duty or work, and yet it kept hovering
before her. Oh, what was it?
</p>
<p>
Did she fall asleep, and was it a vision, a vague
remembrance of something she had heard? Bess
was not dead, but in a strange, strange sleep.
Once there had been a little girl in just this sleep,
and One had come—yes, she would get up—about
midnight these strange charms worked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p>
She would get up and go softly over to Bess.
She would take the little hand in hers; she would
kiss the pale, still lips, and say, “Bess, my darling,
wake up. I can’t live without you. You
have had such a nice long rest. Open your eyes
an’ look at me. Bess, dear, you remember we are
to go to heaven in the spring. <em>He</em> will be waitin’
for us, an’ wonderin’ why we don’t come. He
is goin’ to fight the giants, to show us the way,
an’ row us over the river to the pallis.”
</p>
<p>
Then the eyes would open blue as the summer
sky, the lips would smile, the little hands reach
out and grow warm. There would be a strange
quiver all through the body, and Bess would sit up
and be alive once more. Oh, the glad cry of joy!
Oh, the wordless, exquisite rapture of that moment!
And Bess, in some mysterious way, would
be better, stronger, and the days would fly by
until the blessed spring came.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Murphy touched her, and roused her from
this trance of delight. She heard her mother’s
voice and started.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a nice sleep ye’ve had,” said Mrs. Murphy’s
kindly voice. “An’ it’s full bedtime, an’
past. They’ve all gone, an’ yer mother wants ye.”
</p>
<p>
Dil groped her way down-stairs. There was a
vicious smell of beer and kerosene-smoke in the
warm room.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s time ye were in bed,” said her mother.
“Ye kin sleep in there,” indicating her own room
with a nod; “fer I’ll not sleep the night with me
child lyin’ dead in the house. Bridget Malone
has kem to stay wid me. We’ll jist sit up.”
</p>
<p>
“O mother,” cried Dil, aghast, “let me sleep in
my own room! I’d rather be there with Bess.”
</p>
<p>
“Is the colleen’s head turned wid grafe?
Sleepin’ wid a corpse! Who iver heerd of sich
a thing? Indade ye’ll not, miss! Go to bed
at wunst, an’ not a word outen you.”
</p>
<p>
Her first impulse was to defy the woman looming
up so tall and authoritative. But the shrewd
sense that comes early to the children of poverty
restrained her. She would be worsted in the end,
so she went reluctantly. Had she dreamed? No,
it must be true. She <em>could</em> waken Bess. Again
the uplifting hope took possession of her. She
seemed wafted away to a beautiful country with
Bess. So absorbing was the vision that it filled
her with a certainty beyond the faintest doubt.
She did not even take off her dress, but lay there
wide-eyed and rapturous.
</p>
<p>
After a while the chatter ceased and the snoring
began. How still it was everywhere! But
Dil was not afraid.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>X—IN THE DESERT ALONE</h2>
<p>
Dilsey Quinn rose with a peculiar lightness of
heart, and seemed walking on air. A curious
tingle sped through her nerves, and her eyes had
a strange light of their own. She pushed the
door open and looked out cautiously. Her mother
was on the lounge. Bridget sat by the stove, her
chair tilted back against the door-jamb. The
lamp had been turned down a little, the stove-lid
lifted; and it made a strange, soft semicircle on
the ceiling, such as Dil had seen around the heads
in pictures when she had stolen a glance at the
show windows.
</p>
<p>
The silence, for that impressed her, in spite of
snoring in different keys, and the weird aspect,
made the room instinct with supernatural life.
Dil did not understand this, but she felt it, and
was filled and possessed by that exaltation of
mysterious faith. She walked softly but fearlessly
across the room,—if she could open the
door without Bridget hearing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
</p>
<p>
John Travis should have seen her at that moment,
with the unearthly radiance on her face,
the uplifted confident eyes.
</p>
<p>
Her small hand was on the knob. She opened
the door—a moment more—
</p>
<p>
Alas! Bridget had an impression, and sprang
up. Seeing the figure she uttered a wild shriek.
</p>
<p>
“A banshee! A banshee!” she cried in a
spasm of terror.
</p>
<p>
Dil stood rooted to the spot. Mrs. Quinn
sprang across the room.
</p>
<p>
“Hould yer murtherin’ tongue!” she cried.
“Why—it’s Dil,” seizing her by the shoulder.
“Whativer are ye doin’, walkin’ in yer slape an’
rousin’ the house? An’ yer’ a fool, Bridget!”
</p>
<p>
Bridget Malone stared at the small grayish
figure, unconvinced.
</p>
<p>
“Wake up, ye omadhoun!” and the mother
shook Dil fiercely. “Ye can’t do nothin’ fer the
child. Let her rist in peace; she’s better off nor
she’s been this many a day.”
</p>
<p>
“O Mrs. Quinn, don’t be hard on the poor
gurrul. She’s bin dreamin’ af the little wan,
bein’ so used to tindin’ on her all hours af the
night. But I thought sure it was Bess’s ghost,
bein’ but half awake mesilf.”
</p>
<p>
“Wid no legs to walk on!” was the sarcastic
rejoinder.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
</p>
<p>
“As af a ghost had need of legs! An’ I won’t
be sittin’ there by the dure—”
</p>
<p>
“Git back to yer bed, Dil, an’ we won’t have
no more sich capers in the dead o’ night, frightin’
folks out of their sinsis.”
</p>
<p>
She led Dil roughly back to her bed. Then
for safe keeping she slipped the chair back just
under the knob, and Dil was a prisoner in a black
hole, a small improvement on that of Calcutta.
</p>
<p>
A whirlwind of passion swept over Dilsey
Quinn—a pitiful, helpless passion. She could
have screamed, she could have torn the bed-clothes
to pieces, or stamped in that uncontrollable
rage and disappointment. But she knew her
mother would beat her, and she was too sore and
helpless to be banged about.
</p>
<p>
Her mother would not let her bring Bess back
to life if she knew. And she could not explain—there
was nothing to be put in words. You just
went and did it. Oh, it seemed as if something
might have helped her, some great, strong power
that made people rich and happy, and gave them
so many lovely things. Bess was only such a
little out of all the big world!
</p>
<p>
And now she would never, never come back.
An awful, cold despair succeeded the passion.
They could never go to heaven together. Bess
was dead, just like Mrs. Bolan, like the people
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
who died in the court. They would take her out
and bury her. That was all!
</p>
<p>
An indescribable horror fell upon Dil. The
horror of the solitude that comes of doubt and
darkness, the ghost of that final solitude that
seems watching at the gates of death. Bess had
gone off, been swallowed up in it, and there was
nothing, nothing!
</p>
<p>
The morning dawned at last. Dil, half-stifled
with bad air, and racked with that fearful mental
inquisition, collapsed. She seemed shrunken
and old, as old as Mrs. Bolan. There was nothing
more for her.
</p>
<p>
Bridget Malone was to stay. The two women
had a cup of coffee together, then Mrs. Quinn
went to see the ’Spensary doctor. When she came
back they spread a sheet over the small table,
and brought out the body of the dead child.
</p>
<p>
“Folks’ll be comin’ in to see it,” she said with
some pride. “An’ she looks that swate no one
need be ashamed of her! She’d been a purty girl
but for the accidint, for that stopped her growin’.
I’ve had a long siege wid her, the Lord knows!
An’ now I must run up to Studdemyer’s an’ tell
’em of the sorrow an’ trouble, an’ mebbe I’ll get
lave to do somethin’ to-morrow. But I’ll be back
afore the men kim in.”
</p>
<p>
Dil moved about silently, and went frequently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
into her own room. The intense fervor and belief
of the night had vanished. The court children
straggled in and stared, half-afraid. The women
said she was better off and out of her trouble;
and now and then one spoke of her being in
heaven.
</p>
<p>
She was not in heaven, Dil knew. And how
could she be better off in the cold, hateful ground
than in her warm, loving arms?
</p>
<p>
One gets strangely accustomed to the dear
dead face. Dil paid it brief visits when no one
else was by. A little change had come over it,—the
inevitable change; but to Dil it seemed as if
Bess was growing sorry that she had died; that
the little shrinking everywhere meant regret.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn came back with a gift from her
sympathetic customer, who imagined she had
found heroic motherly devotion in this poor
woman who had four children to care for. There
were numberless visitors who gossiped and were
treated to beer—there was quite a dinner, with an
immense steak to grace the feast.
</p>
<p>
Presently a man came in and took the measure
of the body, and then went up-stairs. An hour
later a wagon stopped before the court, and two
men shouldered a coffin. The small one went into
the Quinns’. It was of stained wood with a muslin
lining, and the little body was laid in its narrow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
home. Then the attendant went up-stairs, and
some of the women followed. There was a confusion
of voices, then the two men came lumbering
down the winding stairs with their load, slid it
into the wagon, while a curious throng gathered
round in spite of the chill blast. They came up
again, one man with a screwdriver in his hand.
</p>
<p>
“Take a look at her, Dil. Poor dear, she’s gone
to her long rest.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn pushed her forward. The women
fell back a little. The man put down the coffin
lid,—it was all in one piece,—and began to screw
it down.
</p>
<p>
Dil gave a wild shriek as it closed over the
pretty golden head, and would have dropped to
the floor, but some one caught her. The man
completed his task, picked up the burthen, it
was so light; and when Dil came out of her faint
Bess, with two other dead bodies, was being jolted
over the stones to a pauper’s grave.
</p>
<p>
“Come now,” began Mrs. Quinn, “it’s full
time ye wer sensible. She’s dead, an’ it’s a
blissid relase, an’ she’s got no more suf’frin’ to go
tru wid. It’s bin a hard thrial, an’ she not able
to take a step this four year. Ye’d better go to
bed an’ rist, for ye look quare ’bout the eyes. Ye
kin have my bed if ye like.”
</p>
<p>
Dil shook her head, and tottered to her own
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
little cot. “O Bess! Bess!” she cried in her
heart, but her lips made no sound. How could
people die who were not old nor sick? For <em>she</em>
wanted to die, but she did not know how.
</p>
<p>
There were people around until after supper.
Then two or three of them went down to Mrs.
MacBride’s. Mrs. Murphy promised to stay with
Dil.
</p>
<p>
“Shure,” said some one, “there’ll be a third
goin’ out prisintly. It’s bad luck when more than
wan corpse goes over the trashold to wunst. An’
that Dil don’t look like long livin’. She’s jist
worn hersilf out wid that other poor thing.”
</p>
<p>
In the evening Patsey came rushing up-stairs
with some Christmas for the two girls. He was
shocked beyond measure. He hardly dared go in
and see Dil, but she called him in a weak, sad
tone.
</p>
<p>
“O Dil!” That was all he said for many minutes,
as he sat on the side of the cot, holding her
hand. The strange look in her face awed him.
</p>
<p>
“Have ye seen Owny?” he whispered.
</p>
<p>
“Not since the night mother beat him.”
</p>
<p>
“Owny—he’s safe. He’ll do well. Don’t
bodder yees poor head ’bout him. He’s keepin’
out o’ der way, ’cause he’s ’fraid de old woman’ll
set de cop on him. He ain’t comin’ back no
more, but don’t you worry. But he’ll feel nawful!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
O Dil, I never s’posed she’d go so soon, if
she was ’pindlin’ an’ weakly. Seemed when she’d
lived so long—”
</p>
<p>
Patsey broke down there.
</p>
<p>
“O Patsey, I didn’t s’pose she could die, jes’
common dyin’ like other folks. They’ve taken
her away an’ put her with dead people—I
don’t know where. You’ll tell <em>him</em>. An’—an’
mebbe ’twould be better if he didn’t come back.
Mother’d beat him nawful, and ’pears ’s if I
couldn’t see any more beatin’s. Don’t tell me
an’ then I won’t know. But you’ll see an’ keep
him safe.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor Dil! I’m jist as sorry’s I kin hold. I
loved you an’ Bess, for I didn’t never hev any
folks,” said the boy brokenly.
</p>
<p>
“An’, Patsey, d’ye mind the wild roses ye
brought in the summer? They was so sweet.
She ’most went crazy over ’em with pure joy.
An’ that night she talked of thim, an’ smelled
thim, an’ it was a bad sign. If I’d knowed, I
might a done somethin’, or had the doctor. An’
she talked so beautiful—”
</p>
<p>
Dil was choked with sobs.
</p>
<p>
“Ye did iverything. Ye were like an angel.
She wouldn’t a lived half so long, but for yous.
O Dil, I wisht I could bring her back. There
was a boy tellin’ ’bout some one—he heerd it at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
the Mission School—that jist took a man outen
his coffin, an’ made him alive. I’ll ask him how
it was, an’ tell yous.”
</p>
<p>
“Ye’s so good, Patsey,” with a weary sigh.
</p>
<p>
“An’ I’ll be droppin’ in an’ bring ye news.
An’ ye mustn’t git sick, fer whin spring opens
we’ll spring a trap that’ll s’prise ye. O Dil
dear!”
</p>
<p>
He bent over and kissed her, his face all wet
with tears. He had often kissed little Bess,
though he was not “soft on gals.” It was a
solemn caress. Dil seemed so far away, as if he
might lose her too.
</p>
<p>
The next morning the Christmas chimes rang
out, and there were houses full of happy children
making merry over Christmas gifts. The mission
schools were crowded, the Christmas-trees and the
feasts thronged. There were hundreds of poor
children made happy, even if they could not take
in the grand truth that eighteen hundred years
ago a Saviour had been born to redeem the world.
“Why is it not redeemed?” cried the cavillers,
looking on. “If the truth is powerful, why has it
not prevailed?” But the children amid their
pleasures asked no questions.
</p>
<p>
Churches were full of melody, homes were full
of joy and gladness, the streets in a tumult of
delight; but Bessy Quinn was in her small grave,
and Dil bitterly alone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
</p>
<p>
John Travis thought of them both this morning.
“I hope Miss Nevins has planned a nice
Christmas for them,” he said to himself, since his
Christmas in a foreign land was not as hopeful as
he could wish. Perhaps Miss Nevins had found
a way to Mrs. Quinn’s heart. Women could
sometimes do better than men.
</p>
<p>
Dilsey Quinn could not die; and if she was
miserable and forlorn she had not the morbid
brain to consider suicide, though she knew people
had killed themselves. But the utter dreariness
of the poor child’s soul was overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
Still, she rose on Monday morning, did her
work, and cared for the babies as usual. It
seemed so cruelly lonesome with only her and
Dan. Mrs. Murphy was very good to her, and
begged her to go to the priest; but she listened in
a weary, indifferent manner. If Bess was in purgatory,
then she would like to go too. But in her
heart she knew Bess wasn’t. She was just dead,
and couldn’t be anywhere but in the ground.
</p>
<p>
She had never known any joyous animal life.
Hers had been all work and loving service.
There was nothing to buoy her up now, nothing
to which she could look forward. She was too
old, too experienced, to be a child, to share a
child’s trivial joys.
</p>
<p>
Her mother questioned her closely about Owen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
Hadn’t he never sneaked in for some clothes?
Didn’t Patsey know where he was?
</p>
<p>
“I’ll ast him if he comes agen,” she said, as
if even Owen was of no moment to her. “He
hasn’t been here sence—sence that night.”
</p>
<p>
“Ye’s not half-witted, Dil Quinn, an’ you grow
stupider every day! Sometime I’ll knock lightnin’
outen yer! An’ if ye dast to keep it from
me that he kem’d home, I’d break yer neck, yer
sassy trollope. He’ll be saunterin’ in some night,
full o’ rags, an’ no place to go, an’ there be a
pairty, now, I tell ye!”
</p>
<p>
But Owny knew when he was well off. Dan
went to school regularly, and was much improved.
</p>
<p>
After the holidays the winter was hard. Work
fell off, and babies were slow coming in. Mrs.
Murphy’s little one took a severe cold, and was
carried off with the croup. She gave up her
rooms and went out to service. So poor Dil lost
another friend.
</p>
<p>
One Sunday during the latter part of January,
Dil summoned up pluck enough to go out for a
walk. There had been three or four lovely days
that suggested spring, bland airs and sunshine,
and the indescribable thrill in the air that stirs
with sudden longing.
</p>
<p>
Dil wandered over to Madison Square. Some
one had given her mother a good warm cloak,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
quite modern. How Bess would have enjoyed
seeing her dressed in it! But though the sun
shone so gloriously, she was cold in body and soul,
as if she could never be warm again. The leafless
branches were full of swallows chirping, but the
flowers were gone, the fountain silent. No one
noted the solitary little figure sitting just where
she had sat that happy afternoon.
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” she cried softly, while her heart swelled
to breaking, and her eyes wandered southward,
“do you know that Bess is dead, an’ we can’t
never go to heaven together as we planned? I
d’know’s I want to now. I jes’ want to die an’ be
put in the ground. I wisht I could be laid ’long-side
of her, an’ I’d stretch out my arms, an’ she’d
come creepin’ to them, jes’ as she used. She’d
know how to find me. An’ when you come back
you can’t see her no more. Oh, ’f we only could
’a’ started that day! An’ mammy burned up
Christiana an’ my beautiful picture, so I’m all
alone. There ain’t nothin’ left,” and she sighed
drearily.
</p>
<p>
Where was he? “’Crost the ’Lantic Oshin,” as
Bess had said. She had no more idea of the
Atlantic Ocean than she had of the location of
heaven; not as much, for it seemed as if heaven
might be over beyond the setting sun. But John
Travis was still in the world. And as she sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
there it seemed as if she must live to tell him
about Bess, and an aim brightened her dreary life.
Two months and a little more. She would come
over often when the weather grew pleasanter.
Already she began to feel better.
</p>
<p>
But she could not take the heartfelt glow back to
Barker’s Court. The loneliness settled down like
a pall. The long, long evenings were intolerable.
Sometimes she crept down and spent an hour
with Mrs. Minch; but she was afraid her mother
might come home inopportunely.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn was growing much worse in her
habits; and she lost her best place, which did not
improve her temper. Dil’s apathetic manner angered
her as well; yet the house was kept cleaner
than ever, her mother’s clothes were always in
order, and there was nothing to find fault about,
except the lack of babies, which Dil could not
help.
</p>
<p>
One night in February there was quite a carouse
at Mrs. MacBride’s. It was midnight when Mrs.
Quinn returned. Poor Dil should have been in
bed, out of harm’s way; but she had been living
over that fateful night, believing with the purest
and most passionate fervor that she might have
called Bess back to life if she could have gone to
her.
</p>
<p>
A man helped Mrs. Quinn up the stairs, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
tumbled her in the door. Dil sprang up in affright.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Quinn stared at Dil with bleared eyes.
</p>
<p>
“What yer doin’ up this time o’ night? Yees
do be enough to set wan crazy wid yer mewlin’,
pinched-up mug that’s humbly as a stun! Why
d’n’ ye laugh an’ hev a good time, an’ make the
house decent, stead er like a grave? I’m not goin’
to stan’ it—d’y hear?”
</p>
<p>
Dil glanced about in alarm, and would have fled
to her room, but her mother caught her by the
arm.
</p>
<p>
“Come,” she cried, “I’ll shake the glumness
outen yer. Why, ye’d spile vinegar even! I’ll
tache ye a little friskiness.”
</p>
<p>
Dil struggled to free herself, but uttered no
word.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tache ye!” she shouted, the devil put into
her by rum driving her to fury. “Ye measlin’,
grouty little thing! forever moanin’ an’ cryin’ fer
the sickly brat that’s gone, good riddance to her!
Come, now, step up lively. We’ll make a night of
it, an’ ye shall hev a sup o’ gin to wet yer t’roat
whin ye get warm.”
</p>
<p>
She whirled Dil about savagely, until she was
dizzy and faint, and broke away in desperation.
But her mother clutched her again, and gave her
a resounding box on the ear. She managed, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>
she was whirled round, to open the door into the
hall, and scream with all the strength she could
summon. Her mother seized her again with a
dreadful imprecation. What happened, how it
happened in the dark, Dil could never clearly
remember.
</p>
<p>
Fred Minch sprang up and opened the door.
Something bumped down the stairs, and lay in a
heap at his feet.
</p>
<p>
“It’s that poor little girl, mother. She’s bleeding,
killed maybe. I’ll run for a policeman.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Minch picked up the senseless child.
Mrs. Quinn went on yelling, swearing, smashing
things, and dancing like a mad woman.
</p>
<p>
Rows were no uncommon thing in the court.
Windows were thrown up. Who was it? Some
wretched wife being beaten? And when they
found it was Mrs. Quinn, they shook their heads.
She had been going to the dogs of late, it was
plain to see.
</p>
<p>
When the officer came, she made such a vigorous
onslaught that he was forced to call assistance.
She was after Owen now, and Dil had
hidden him. The threats she uttered were enough
to make one shudder. They mastered her at
length, and dragged her down-stairs, where Mrs.
Minch was waiting to explain poor Dil’s plight.
</p>
<p>
She was still unconscious when the ambulance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
came. There was a bad cut up in the edge of
her hair, but no bones seemed to be broken that
any one could discover.
</p>
<p>
“Poor child!” said Mrs. Minch, when quiet was
restored. “It would be a blessing if she could
go with Bess. She’ll never get over the loss.
She’s not been the same since, and many a day
my heart’s ached for her.”
</p>
<p>
“She were a nice smart woman, that Mrs.
Quinn, if she’d a let rum alone,” was the general
verdict. “An’ though she took the child’s death
in a sensible manner, it broke her all up,” said
some of the court people, “and she went to hard
drinking at once.”
</p>
<p>
When Mrs. Quinn’s trial came on, Dil’s life was
still hanging in a doubtful balance. She was sent
to the Island for ninety days, for drunkenness and
assaulting the policeman, and would there await
the final result.
</p>
<p>
But Mrs. MacBride went on adding to her bank
account and her real estate, to the wreck of youth
and womanhood, to the prisons and paupers’
graves. She kept such a very respectable place,
the law never meddled with her.
</p>
<p>
Dilsey Quinn lay on her hospital pallet delirious,
but never violent, and lapsing into unconsciousness.
She had a dislocated shoulder, two broken
ribs, and sundry bruises; but it was the years of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
hard work, foul air, dark rooms, and unsanitary
conditions that the doctors had to fight against
blindly. Her bruised and swollen face, her
stubby, red-brown hair that had been cut short,
her wide mouth and short nose, made no appeal in
the name of beauty. She was merely a “case.”
</p>
<p>
Her nurse was a youngish, kindly woman, used
to such incidents. Beaten wives and children
were often sent to her ward. In the early part of
her experience she had suffered with them. Now
she had grown—not unsympathetic, but wiser;
tender she would always be.
</p>
<p>
Now and then there was something so wistful
in the child’s eyes that it touched her heart. She
lay so patient and uncomplaining, she made so
little trouble.
</p>
<p>
But sometimes the woman wondered why they
were brought into the world to suffer, starve, and
die. What wise purpose was served?
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>XI—WHEN HE AND SUMMER COMES</h2>
<p>
One morning Dilsey Quinn looked slowly and
curiously around the ward, and then asked the
nurse how she came there.
</p>
<p>
She lay a long while, piecing out the story, remembering
what was back of it.
</p>
<p>
“As you did not die, your mother will come
out of the Island early in June. I suppose it was
a sort of accident. Was she used to beating
you?”
</p>
<p>
A flush went over the pallid face.
</p>
<p>
“No,” she replied quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Do you want to go back to her?”
</p>
<p>
“O, no, no!” with a note of terror in the
voice. “I couldn’t live with her no more.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you any friends?”
</p>
<p>
There was a hesitating look, but the child did
not answer. Had she any friend? Yes, Patsey.
</p>
<p>
“How would you like to go to some of the
Homes? You would be well treated and taught
some trade,” the nurse ventured kindly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
</p>
<p>
“I can work for myself,” returned Dil, with
quiet decision. “I can keep house, an’ tend
babies, an’ wash an’ iron.”
</p>
<p>
“Would you like a nice place in the country?”
</p>
<p>
“I want to stay in the city,” she said slowly.
“There’s some one I want to see. It’s ’bout my
little sister that’s dead. I can soon get some
work.”
</p>
<p>
“How old are you?”
</p>
<p>
“I shall be fifteen long in the summer, a spell
after Fourth of July.”
</p>
<p>
“You are very small. Are you quite sure?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes. Why, you see, I was fourteen last
summer. Jack was next to me. Then Bess.
She was ’leven, but she hadn’t grown any ’cause
she was hurted.”
</p>
<p>
“Hurt? How?” the nurse asked with interest.
The children told their stories so simply.
</p>
<p>
“Along o’ father’s bein’ nawful drunk an’
slammin’ her agin the wall. He went to prison
’cause he most killed a man. Bess died just
before Christmas. We was goin’—”
</p>
<p>
Dil paused. Would nurse know anything about
a journey to heaven?
</p>
<p>
“Were you going to run away? But if the
poor little girl was hurt, she is better off. God is
taking care of her in heaven.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no. She isn’t there. She’s just dead.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
We was goin’ together in the spring, and—and
some one was going with us who knew all ’bout
the way.”
</p>
<p>
“My child, what do you know about heaven?”
asked the nurse, struck by the confident tone.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know—much. I heard ’bout it at the
Mission School, and told Bess. We wanted to go
like Christiana. We met a man in the square
last summer, an’ he told us ’bout his Lord Jesus,
that he could cure little hurted legs that hadn’t
ever grown any and couldn’t walk. An’ he promised
to go to heaven with us. We was goin’ to
start then, but we didn’t just know the way. I’d
learned ’bout the river in the Mission School.
An’ he said he’d bring us the book ’bout Christiana,
an’ then we’d know; but we better wait,
for it would be so cold before we got there, an’
the cold shrivelled up poor little Bess so. Well,
we waited an’ waited, but he did come, an’ he
brought the book. It was so lovely.” Dil gave a
long, rapturous sigh, and a glory shone in her
eyes. “An’ we found out ’bout crossin’ the river
an’ the pallis. We see her goin’ up the steps.
An’ then mammy took the book an’ burnt it up
in a tantrum, an’ we couldn’t read it any more,
but we’d got the pictures all fixed in our minds.
Curis, isn’t it, how you can see things that ain’t
there, when you’ve got thim all fixed in your
mind?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p>
“And you were going to heaven?” Nurse was
amazed at the great, if misplaced, faith. “And
your friend—”
</p>
<p>
The soft, suggestive voice won Dil to further
confidence.
</p>
<p>
“He had to go ’way crost the ’Lantic Oshin.
But he would have come back. He did just what
he told you, always. An’ that’s why I must get
well an’ go back an’ see him an’ tell him—”
</p>
<p>
The voice faltered, and the eyes overflowed with
tears. Dil’s hearer was greatly moved.
</p>
<p>
“Bess has gone to heaven first, my poor dear,”
but her own voice was tremulous with emotion.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, she couldn’t. Why, she couldn’t walk, with
her poor hurted legs, ’n’ ’twas so cold ’n’ all. An’
she wouldn’t ’a’ gone to the very best heaven,
not even the pallis shinin’ with angels, athout
me.”
</p>
<p>
“But you don’t understand”—how should she
explain to the literal understanding. “The Lord
came for her, took her in his arms, and carried her
to heaven.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he wouldn’t ’a’ taken her athout sayin’ a
word, and leaved me behind, ’cause he must ’a’
knowed we was plannin’ to go together. No;
she’s just dead like other folks. An’ <em>he</em> can’t see
her when he comes.”
</p>
<p>
There was a long, dreary, tearless sob.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my poor child, she <em>is</em> safe with the Lord.
Do you really know who God is?”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Travis’s Lord Jesus lives in heaven,” said
Dil, in a kind of weary, half-puzzled tone. “He
told us how he come down to some place, I disremember
now, an’ cured hurted people, an’ made
blind folks see, an’ fed the hungry, an’ went back
an’ fixed a beautiful pallis for them. There’s lots
more in Barker’s Court that they swear by, but
them ain’t the ones Mr. Travis meant.”
</p>
<p>
The nurse was as much astonished by the confident
ignorance as Mr. Travis had been, and felt
quite as helpless.
</p>
<p>
“I wish you could believe that little Bess is in
heaven,” she said gently.
</p>
<p>
“She couldn’t be happy athout me,” the poor
child replied confidently, with tears in her faltering
voice. “I always tended her, an’ curled her
hair, an’ wheeled her about, an’—an’ loved her
so.” The tone sank to a touching pathos. “An’
she didn’t go crost no river—she couldn’t stand
up ’thout bein’ held. An’ oh, do you s’pose I’d
gone an’ left Bess for anything? No more would
she gone an’ left me.”
</p>
<p>
The brown eyes were heart-breaking in their
trustful simplicity. The child’s confidence was
beyond any stage of persuasion. With time one
might unravel the tangle in her untutored brain,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
but she could not in the brief while the child
would remain in the hospital.
</p>
<p>
“Tell me about your friend, Mr. Travis,” the
nurse said, after a silence of some moments.
</p>
<p>
“He painted pictures, an’ he made a beautiful
one of Bess. But mammy burned it with the
book. She said there wasn’t any heaven anyway.
An’ Mrs. Murphy said it was purgatory, ’n’ if you
paid money, you’d get out. But Bess would go
there. An’ <em>he</em> didn’t say nothin’ ’bout purgatory.
He come one day an’ sang the beautifullest hymn
’bout ’everlastin’ spring,’ an’ everybody cried.
Poor old Mrs. Bolan was there. But when he
comes back he’ll tell me just how it is.”
</p>
<p>
Perhaps that was best. Nurse went about her
duties, the strange, sweet, entire faith haunting
her. And the pathos of the two setting out for
a literal heaven!
</p>
<p>
There were days when Dil sat in a vague, absent
mood, her eyes staring into vacancy, seeming
to hear nothing that went on about her. But she
improved slowly; and though the nurse tried to
persuade her to go to some friends of hers, she
found the child wonderfully resolute.
</p>
<p>
And yet, when she was discharged, an awful
sense of loneliness came over Dilsey Quinn. The
nurse gave her a dollar, and an address to which
she was to apply in case of any misfortune.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
</p>
<p>
“You’ve been so good,” Dil said, with swimming
eyes. “An’ I’ll promise if I don’t get no
place.”
</p>
<p>
And now she must find John Travis. He
would surely know if Bess could get to heaven
in any strange way, alone in the night. And if
she was there, then Dil must go straightway. She
could not even lose a day.
</p>
<p>
The world looked curious to her this April day.
There were golden quivers in the sunshine, and a
laughing blueness in the sky. And oh, such a
lovely, fragrant air! Dil felt as if she could skip
for very joy.
</p>
<p>
She found her way to the square, and sat down
on the olden seat. Already some flowers were
out, and the grass was green. The “cop” came
around presently, but she was not afraid of him
now. She rose and spoke to him, recalling the
summer afternoon and the man who had made
pictures of herself and Bess.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know who he was. No, he hasn’t
been back to inquire.” The policeman would not
have known Dil.
</p>
<p>
“His name was Mr. John Travis. He writ it on
Bess’s picture. I was so ’fraid I’d miss him. But
he will come, ’cause he can’t find no one in Barker’s
Court. An’ when I get a place, I’ll come
an’ bring the number, so’s you can tell him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I’ll be on the lookout for him.” The
child’s grave, innocent faith touched him. How
pale and thin she was!
</p>
<p>
Then she considered. Mrs. Minch would be in
the court, she thought. Perhaps she might steal
in without any one seeing her who would tell her
mother afterward. And she could hear about
Dan.
</p>
<p>
She stopped at a baker’s, and bought some
lunch. But by and by she began to grow very
tired, and walked slowly, looking furtively about.
She was almost at Barker’s Court when a familiar
whistle startled her.
</p>
<p>
“O Dil Quinn, Dil!” cried a dear, well remembered
voice.
</p>
<p>
Patsey Muldoon caught her hand as if he would
never let it go. He had half a mind to kiss her
in the street, he was that glad. His eyes danced
with joy.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been layin’ out fer ye, Dil, hangin’ round
an’ waitin’. I was dead sure yous’d come back
here. An’ I’ve slipped in Misses Minch’s, an’
jes’ asked ’bout the old gal, an’ I told her ’f you
come, jes’ to hold on t’ye.”
</p>
<p>
“O Patsey!”
</p>
<p>
“How nawful thin ye air, Dil. Have ye got
railly well?”
</p>
<p>
Dil swallowed over a great lump in her throat,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
and had much ado not to cry, as she said, “I’m
not so strong.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we want ye, we jes’ do,” and he laughed.
</p>
<p>
“What for?” It was so good to have any one
want her in this desolation, that she drew nearer,
and he put her hand in his arm in a very protecting
fashion.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll tell ye. See, now, we was boardin’
with an old woman. There was five of us, but
Fin, he waltzed off. The old woman died suddint
like three weeks ago, an’ we’ve bin keepin’ house
sence. The lan’lord he come round, ’n’ we promised
the rent every Monday, sure pop; an’ we paid
it too,” proudly. “We’ve got Owny. I’ve had
to thrash him twict, but he’s doin’ fus’ rate now.
An’ he sed, if we could git a holt o’ yous! He
said ye made sech lickin’ good stews ’n’ coffee
’twould make a feller sing in his sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“O Patsey, you alwers was so good!” Dil
wiped her eyes. This unlooked-for haven was
delightful beyond any words.
</p>
<p>
“’Twas norful quair I sh’d meet you, wasn’t it?
An’ we jes’ won’t let any one in de court know it,
’n’ they can’t blow on us. The ould woman’s up
on de Island, but her time’ll soon be out. Dan,
he’s gone to some ’stution. We’ll keep shet o’
her. She’s a peeler, she is! Most up to the boss
in a shindy, now, wasn’t she? But when dey begins to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
go to de Island, de way gits aisy fer ’em,
an’ dey keep de road hot trottin’ over it.”
</p>
<p>
Dil sighed, and shuddered too. We suppose
the conscious tie of nature begets love, but it had
not in Dil’s case. And she had a curious feeling
that she should drop dead if her mother should
clutch her.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want to see her, Patsey, never agen.
Poor Bess is gone—”
</p>
<p>
“Jes’ don’t you mind. My eyes is peeled fer
de old woman! An’ where I’m goin’ to take
you’s so far off. But we’ll jes’ go an’ hev some
grub. We’ll take de car. I’m out ’n a lark, I
am!”
</p>
<p>
Patsey laughed, a wholesome, inspiriting sound.
Dil was very, very tired, and it was so good to sit
down. She felt so grateful, so befriended, so at
rest, as if her anxieties had suddenly ended.
</p>
<p>
It was indeed a long distance,—a part of the
city Dil knew nothing about,—across town and
down town, in the old part, given over to business
and the commonest of living. A few blocks after
they left the car they came to a restaurant, and
Patsey ordered some clam-chowder. It tasted so
good to the poor little girl, and was so warming,
that her cheeks flushed a trifle.
</p>
<p>
Patsey amused her with their ups and downs,
the scrapes Owny had been in, and some of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
virtues as well. Patsey might have adorned some
other walk in life, from the possibilities of fairness
and justice in his character.
</p>
<p>
Dil began to feel as if she belonged to the old
life again. Her hospital experience, with the
large, clean rooms, the neatness, the flowers, the
visitors, and her kindly nurse, seemed something
altogether outside of her own life.
</p>
<p>
They trudged along, and stopped at the end of
a row of old-fashioned brick houses, two stories,
with dormer windows. A wide alley-way went up
by the last one. There was a building in the
rear that had once been a shop, but now housed
four families. Up-stairs lived some Polish tailors;
at the lower end, a youngish married couple.
</p>
<p>
It was quite dusk now, but a lamp was lighted
in the room. Two fellows were skylarking, but
they stopped suddenly at the unusual sight of a
“gal.”
</p>
<p>
“Why it ain’t never Dil!”
</p>
<p>
Owny was an immense exclamation point in
supreme amazement.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t I tell yous! I was a-layin’ fer her.
An’ she’s jes’ come out o’ the ’ospital.”
</p>
<p>
“Dil, you look nawful white.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll make her hev red cheeks in a little,
jes’ you wait. This feller’s Tom Dillon.”
</p>
<p>
Dilsey took a survey of her new home, and for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
the first moment her heart failed her. It looked
so dreadfully dirty and untidy. The room was
quite large, with an old lounge, a kitchen table,
a trunk, and some chairs; a stove in the fireplace,
and a cupboard with the door swinging
open, but the dishes seemed to be mostly on the
table.
</p>
<p>
“We sleep here,” explained Patsey, ushering
her into the adjoining apartment. There was an
iron bedstead in the centre of the room, and four
bunks in two stories ranged against the side.
“Ye see, we ain’t much at housekeepin’, but
youse c’n soon git things straight,” and Patsey
laughed to hide a certain shame and embarrassment.
“We’ll clean house to-morrer, an’ hev
things shinin’. An’ here’s a place—”
</p>
<p>
It was a little corner taken off the other room,
and partly shut in by the closet. “Th’ ould
woman used to sleep here—say, Dil, yous wouldn’t
be afraid—tell ye, a feller offered me a lot o’
paper—wall paper, an’ we’ll make it purty as a
pink.”
</p>
<p>
Dil had never seen “th’ ould woman,” and had
no fear of her.
</p>
<p>
“It’ll be nice when we get it fixed,” she said
cheerily.
</p>
<p>
Then Sandy Fossett came in, and was “introjuced.”
He, too, had heard the fame of the ’lickin’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
good stews,’ but he was surprised to find such a
very little body.
</p>
<p>
Dil lay on the lounge that night, but did not
sleep much, it was all so strange. Any other
body would have felt disheartened in the morning,
but Patsey was “so good.” He “hustled” the
few things out of the little room, asked the woman
in the other part about making paste, and ran off
for his paper. Dil found a scrubbing-brush, and
had the closet partly cleaned when he returned.
Mrs. Brian came in and “gave them a hand.”
She was a short, stout, cheery body, with just
enough Irish to take warmly to Dil.
</p>
<p>
If the poor child had small aptitude for book-learning,
she had the wonderful art of housekeeping
at her very finger ends. In a week the boys
hardly knew the place. Dil’s little room was
really pretty, with its paper of grasses and field
flowers on the lightest gray ground. She scalded
and scrubbed her cot, and drove out any ghost
that might have lingered about; she made a new
“bureau” out of grocery boxes, not that she had
any clothes at present, but she might have. She
was so thankful for a home that work was a pleasure
to her, though she did get very, very tired,
and a pain would settle in the place where the
ribs were broken.
</p>
<p>
The living room took on a delightful aspect.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
The chairs were scrubbed and painted, the table
was cleaned up and covered with enamelled cloth.
And such coffee as Dil made; such stews of meat
and potatoes and onions, and a carrot or a bit of
parsley; and oh, such soups and chowders! When
she made griddlecakes the boys went out and
stood on their heads—there was no other way to
express their delight. Fin came back in a jiffy,
and another lad, named Shorty by his peers. Indeed,
there could have been ten if there had been
room.
</p>
<p>
Owen was very much improved. He was shooting
up into a tall boy, and had his mother’s black
eyes and fresh complexion. When the two boys
talked about Bess, Dil could almost imagine her
coming back. She sometimes tried to make believe
that little Bess had gone to the hospital to
get her poor hurted legs mended, and would
surely return to them.
</p>
<p>
There was quite a pretty yard between the two
houses. It really belonged to the “front” people.
There was a grass-plot and some flowers, and
an old honeysuckle climbing the porch. The air
was much better than in Barker’s Court, and altogether
it was a more humanizing kind of living.
And though the people up-stairs ran a sewing-machine
in the evening, there were no rows. Mr.
Brian did some kind of work on the docks, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
went away early, coming back at half-past six or
so. He was a nice, steady sort of fellow; and
though he had protested vigorously against a
“raft of boys” keeping house, after Dil came
he was very friendly.
</p>
<p>
Patsey also “laid out” for Mrs. Quinn. When
she came down from the “Island,” she heard that
her furniture had been set in the street, and then
taken in by some of the neighbors. Dan was in
a Home, Owen had not been seen, neither had
Dilsey. Then the woman drank again and raged
round like a tiger, was arrested, but pleaded so
hard, and promised amendment so earnestly, that
sentence was suspended.
</p>
<p>
It was well that Owen and Dilsey kept out of
her way, for if she had found either of them she
would have wreaked a full measure of vengeance
upon them. There had never been a great deal
of tenderness in her nature, and her experiences
of the last ten years had not only hardened but
brutalized her. The habit of steady drinking had
blunted her natural feelings more than occasional
outbreaks with weeks of soberness. She had no
belief in a future state and no regard for it. Still,
she had not reached that last stage of demoralization—she
was willing to work; and when she had
money to spend, Mrs. MacBride made her welcome
again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
</p>
<p>
After Dil had her house a little in order, and
had made herself a new gingham gown, she took
her way one lovely afternoon over to Madison
Square. She had meant to tell Patsey about
John Travis, but an inexplicable feeling held her
back. How she was coming to reach after higher
things, or that they were really higher, she did
not understand. Heaven was still a great mystery
to her. With the boys Bess was simply dead,
gone out of life, and sometime everybody seemed
to go out of life. Why they did was the inscrutable
mystery?
</p>
<p>
It was curious, but now she had no desire to
finish Christiana, although she devoted some time
every day to reading. The old things that had
been such a pleasure seemed sacred to Bess, laid
away, awaiting a mysterious solution. For she
<em>knew</em> John Travis could tell her all about it.
</p>
<p>
Patsey had written her name and address on a
slip of paper, several of them indeed, so as not to
raise any suspicion. He laughed, and said she
“was very toney, wantin’ kerds.” She saw the
policeman, and was relieved that she had not
missed Travis, yet strangely disappointed that he
had not come.
</p>
<p>
The boys just adored her, and certainly they
were a jolly lot. Sometimes they had streaks of
luck, at others they were hard up. But every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
Saturday night the rent money was counted out
to make sure, and the agent was soon greatly interested
in her. She was a wonderful little market woman,
and she found so much entertainment
going out to do errands. She used to linger about
the flower stands, and thrill with emotions that
seemed strange indeed to her. She took great
pleasure in watching the little flower bed a thin,
delicate looking woman used to tend, that belonged
to the front house.
</p>
<p>
One day Patsey brought her home a rose.
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” she cried, “if Bess was only here to
see!” and tears overflowed her eyes. “O Patsey,
do you mind them wild roses the lady gev
you an’ you brought to us? They’re always
keepin’ in my mind with Bess.”
</p>
<p>
“I wisht I knew where they growed, I’d go fer
some. But ain’t this a stunner?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s jes’ splendid, an’ you’re so good, Patsey.”
</p>
<p>
“I wisht yer cheeks cud be red as that,” the
boy said earnestly.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Brian went out now and then to do a bit
of washing, “unbeknownst to her man,” who
thought he earned enough for both of them. She
came and sat on the little stoop with Dil occasionally,
and had a “bit of a talk.” Patsey had
advised that she should let folks think both her
parents were dead—he had said so in the first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
instance to make her coming with them seem
reasonable.
</p>
<p>
But one day she told Mrs. Brian about little
Bess, “who was hurted by a bad fall, and died last
winter.” Then she ventured on a wonder about
heaven, hoping for some tangible explanation.
</p>
<p>
“I s’pose it’s a good thing to go to heaven when
you’re sick, or old an’ all tired out, but I ain’t in
any hurry. I want a good bit o’ fun an’ pleasure
first. My man sez if you’re honest an’ do the fair
thing, it’s as good a religion as he wants, an’ he’ll
trust it to take any one there. My ’pinion is that
some of them that talks about it don’t appear to
know, when you pin ’em down to the pint. My
man thinks most everybody who ain’t awful
bad’ll go. There’s some folks so dreadful you
know, that the devil really ought to have ’em for
firewood.”
</p>
<p>
No one seemed in any hurry to go. It was a
great mystery to Dil. And now Barker’s Court
seemed as if it must have been the City of Destruction.
If only her mother had been like
Christiana! It was all such a puzzle. She was
so lonely, and longed for some satisfying comfort.
</p>
<p>
The weather was so lovely again. Ah! if Bess
had not died, they would have started by themselves,
she felt quite sure. And as the days
passed with no John Travis, Dil sometimes grew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
cold and sick at heart. In spite of the boys’ merriment
and kindliness, she could not get down to
the real hold on life. It seemed to her as if she
was wandering off in some strange land, when she
used to sit alone and wonder; it could hardly be
called thinking, it was so intangible.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>XII—THE RESPONSE OF PINING EYES</h2>
<p>
The boys chipped in one evening and took Dil
to the theatre. They were fond of the rather
coarse fun and stage heroics. Dil was simply
bewildered with the lights, the blare of the second-rate
orchestra, and the crowds of people. She
was a little afraid too. What if they should meet
some one who knew her mother?
</p>
<p>
A curious thought came to her unappeased soul.
Some one was singing a song, one of the rather
pathetic ballads just then a favorite. She did
not see the stage nor the young man, but like a
distinct vision the little room in Barker’s Court
was before her eyes. Bess in her old wagon, Mrs.
Murphy with her baby in her arms, old Mrs. Bolan,
and the group of listening women. The wonderful
rapture in Bess’s face was distinct. It was
the sweet old hymn that she was listening to, the
voice that stilled her longing soul, that filled her
with content unutterable.
</p>
<p>
There was a round of applause that brought her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
back to the present life. They were rather noisy
here. She liked the dreamland best.
</p>
<p>
“That takes the cake jist!” declared Patsey,
looking down in the bewildered face. “What’s
the matter? Youse look nawful pale!”
</p>
<p>
“My head aches,” she said. “It’s so warm
here. And it’s all very nice, but will it be over
soon, Patsey?”
</p>
<p>
The boy <em>was</em> disappointed; but the next morning
Dil evinced such a cordial interest in all the
points that had amused them, that Patsey decided
that it must have been the headache, and not lack
of appreciation.
</p>
<p>
But he hung around after the others were gone,
with a curious sense of responsibility.
</p>
<p>
“Youse don’t git reel well any more, Dil,” he
said, his voice full of solicitude. “Kin I do
anythin’—”
</p>
<p>
“O Patsey!” The quick tears came to her
eyes. “Why, I <em>am</em> well, an’ everything’s so nice
now, an’ Mrs. Brian jes’ lovely. Mebbe I ain’t
quite so strong sence I was sick. An’ sometimes
I get lonesome with you away all day.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish youse knowed some gals—”
</p>
<p>
“Patsey,” a soft, tender light came to her
brown eyes, “I think I miss the babies. They’re
so cunnin’ an’ sweet, an’ put their arms round
your neck an’ say such pritty little words. An’ if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
I could have some babies I wouldn’t wash any
more. That puts me out o’ breath like, an’ hurts
my side. ’Twas that tired me for last night.”
</p>
<p>
“Youse jist sha’n’t wash no more, then. But
babies is such a bother!”
</p>
<p>
“I love thim so. An’ only two, maybe. Curis
there ain’t a baby in this house, nor in the front,
neither. Babies would seem like old times, when
I had Bess.”
</p>
<p>
There was such a wistful look in her pale, tender
face. Patsey thought she had grown a great
deal prettier, but he wished she had red cheeks.
And he was moved to go out at once and hunt up
the babies.
</p>
<p>
Other girls might have made friends in the
neighborhood; but Dil had never acquired friendly
arts, and now she shrank from companionship.
But she liked Mrs. Brian; and that very afternoon
as they sat together Dil ventured to state her
desires.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t look fit to bother with ’em. You
ought to be out pleasurin’ a bit.”
</p>
<p>
“But I’m strong, though; an’ I used to be such
a fat little chunk! I was stunted like; but I think
I look better not to be so fat,” she said with quaint
self-appreciation.
</p>
<p>
“There’s one baby I could get for you easy.
The mother’s a nice body—you see, the man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
went off. She’s waitress in a restaurant, an’ her
little girl’s pretty as a pink, with a head full of
yellow curls, an’ big blue eyes. She pays a dollar
for her keep, ’ceptin’ nights an’ Sundays. An’
you’d be so good, which the woman ain’t. You
couldn’t hurt a fly if you tried.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, if I could have her!” cried Dil eagerly.
A little girl with golden hair, curly hair. And
a dollar would pay for the washing and ironing.
The boys had been so good about fixing up things
and buying her clothes that she had felt she must
do all she could in return.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll see about it this very evenin’, dear.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thank you! thank you!”
</p>
<p>
The mother, a slim young thing, came to visit
Dil on Sunday, with pretty, chubby, two-year-old
Nelly, who was not shy at all, and came and
hugged Dil at once. Her prettiness was not of
the <em>spirituelle</em> order, as Bess’s would have been
under any circumstances. The eyes were merry
and wondering, the voice a gay little ripple, and
comforted Dil curiously.
</p>
<p>
And through the course of the week several
“incidental” ones came. It <em>was</em> like old times.
</p>
<p>
“Seems to me it’s nawful tough to be nussin’
kids,” said Patsey; “but, Dil, you’ve chirked up an’
grown reel jolly. You’re hankerin’ arter Bess, an’
can’t forgit. An’ ef the babies make ye chipper,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
let ’em come. I only hope they won’t take any
fat offen yer bones, fer youse most a skiliton now.
But sounds good to hear youse laugh agen.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like just a little fat in my cheeks,” she
made answer.
</p>
<p>
Patsey brought her home a white dress one
day, and said they would all go down to Coney
Island some Sunday.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t dast to,” she said. “I’d be that
afeared o’ meetin’ mother. She used to go las’
summer. An’ if she should find me—”
</p>
<p>
“Yer cudden’t find anybody, les’ yer looked
sharp. An’ youse er that changed an’ sollumn
lookin’ an’ big-eyed, no one’d know yer.”
</p>
<p>
“But <em>you</em> knew me,” with a grateful little smile.
</p>
<p>
Patsey grinned and rolled his eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I was a-layin’ fer ye.”
</p>
<p>
“You can take me up to Cent’l Park, Patsey.
I’d like to go so much.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s the talk, now! So I will. We’ll all
go. We’ll have a reg’lar persesh, a stunner, an’
take our lunch, like the ’ristocrockery!”
</p>
<p>
Dil did brighten up a good deal. Baby kisses
helped. She was starving for love, such as boys
did not know how to give. She used to take
Nelly out walking, and imagine her her very own.
The mother instinct was strong in Dil.
</p>
<p>
Having the washing done did ease up the work;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
though one would have considered it no sinecure
to feed five hungry boys. Now and then her
head would ache, and occasionally something
inside of her would flutter up in her throat, as it
had when Bess died, and she would stretch out
her hands to clasp some warm human support,
her whole body in a shiver of vague terror.
</p>
<p>
If John Travis would only come. She <em>could
not</em> disbelieve in him. Last autumn in the moment
of desperate despair he had come, bringing
such a waft of joy and satisfaction. There were
so many things she wanted to ask him. She
began to hope, in a vague way, that the Lord
had come for Bess, for she wanted her in that
beautiful heaven. But the mystery was too great
for her untrained mind. And there intruded upon
her thought, the horror of that moment when
she knew Bess was dead.
</p>
<p>
The hot weather was very trying. Hemmed
in on all sides by tall buildings, her own room so
small, with a window on a narrow space hardly
six inches from the brick wall of the next house,
there was little chance for air. The boys seemed
to sleep through anything.
</p>
<p>
So the weeks passed on with various small delights
and events. The boys would go off and
spend their money when they needed clothes,
and then would follow heroic efforts at economizing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
Dil had such shrewd good sense, and they
did listen to her gentle advice. They were a gay,
rollicking lot, but their very spirits seemed to be
of a world she had passed by. It was as if she
was on the way to some unknown land, not quite
a stranger, but a sojourner.
</p>
<p>
Owen was a really tolerable boy, and bade fair
to keep out of the reform school. They all
mended of their swearing; they were ready to
wait on her at a word.
</p>
<p>
The white frock was a beauty. Shorty brought
her some pink ribbons that made her look less
pale, and she had a wreath of wild roses on her
hat that Mrs. Brian gave her.
</p>
<p>
They made ready for their excursion one beautiful
Sunday morning in July. There had been
a tremendous shower the night before, and all
nature was fresh and glowing. The very sky was
full of suggestions in its clear, soft blue, with
here and there a white drift.
</p>
<p>
Oh, how lovely the park looked! Dil had to
pause in a strange awe, as if she was hardly prepared
to enter. It was like the hymn that was
always floating intangibly through her mind—the
fields and rivers of delight, the fragrant air,
the waving trees and beds of flowers, the beautiful
nooks, the bridges, the winding paths that seemed
leading into delicious mysteries.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
</p>
<p>
The boys were wild over the animals. They
were irrepressible, and soon tired out poor Dil.
She had to sit down and press her hand on her
heart. There was a strange sinking, as if she
was floating off, like the fleecy white drifts above
her.
</p>
<p>
“Youse air nawful white!” cried Patsey in
alarm. “An’ ther’s sich a queer blue streak
acrost yer lip. Air ye sick?”
</p>
<p>
She drew a long breath, and the world seemed
to settle again, as she raised her soft eyes with
a smile all about them.
</p>
<p>
“No, Patsey—I’m only a bit tired. Let me
sit an’ get rested.”
</p>
<p>
She took the sunbrowned hand in hers with a
mute little caress that brought a strange flush to
the lad’s face.
</p>
<p>
“Youse jist work too hard wid dem babies an’
all.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m only going to have Nelly next week, an’
the Leary baby is to go in the country with his
mother to live. ’Twasn’t nothin’ but a queer
flutt’rin’ like, an’ it comes sometimes in the night
when I <em>can’t</em> be tired. It’s all over now;” and
she looked bright and happy, if still pale.
</p>
<p>
Patsey seemed hardly satisfied.
</p>
<p>
“I think it’s the hot weather. It’s been so
hot, you know. An’ to-day’s splendid! I’ll get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
better when cool weather comes, I’m most sure.
You an’ the boys take a good long walk, an’ I’ll
stay here with the lunch, an’ get all rested up.
An’ I’ll make b’leve it’s heaven; it’s so beautiful.”
</p>
<p>
“See here, Dil, don’t yer go an’ be thinkin’
’bout—’bout heaven an’ sich—”
</p>
<p>
Patsey swallowed over a big lump in his throat,
and winked vigorously.
</p>
<p>
“Bess an’ I used to talk about it,” she said in a
soft, disarming fashion. “We thought ’twas some-wers
over the river there,” nodding her head.
“But I’ll jes’ sit still in some shady place, an’ I
won’t go to-day,” with a soft, comforting laugh.
</p>
<p>
The boys protested at first. But Dil had a way
of persuading them that was quite irresistible.
They were boys to the full, and to sit still would
have half killed them. They found a lovely nook,
where she could see the lake and the boats, and
the people passing to and fro in their Sunday attire.
There were merry voices of little ones that
touched her like music.
</p>
<p>
She sat very still, with the lunch-basket at her
feet. Occasionally some one cast a glance at the
pale little girl in her white gown, with the wild
roses drooping over the brim of her hat. A
friendly policeman had seen the pantomime and
the departure of the boys, and meant to keep
guard that no one molested her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
</p>
<p>
Dil could understand being ill from some specific
disease; but she did not feel ill, only tired. It
was a different kind of fatigue from that back in
Barker’s Court, for then she could fall asleep in a
moment. Now the nights were curiously wakeful.
And the babies <em>were</em> heavy, even if there
were only two of them.
</p>
<p>
The refreshing atmosphere and the tranquil,
beautiful pictures all about her intensified the
thought of the heaven she was going to “make
b’leve” about. She could picture it out, up and
up, through country ways and flowers, wild roses
maybe. Houses where they took you in and fed
you, and put you to bed in such soft, clean beds.
Queer people too, who couldn’t understand, and
were wanting to turn back,—people who were
afraid of lions and Giant Grim. She called up all
the pictures she could remember, and they floated
before her like a panorama.
</p>
<p>
“Though I can’t get it out straight myself,”
and she sighed in helpless confusion. “I ain’t
smart as little Bess was, an’ can’t see into things.
But I could push Bess along, an’ Mr. Travis would
be Mr. Greatheart for us, an’ he’d know the way
on ’count of his being book learned. An’ we’d
just be kerful an’ not get into briars and bad
places.”
</p>
<p>
Was that Bess laughing softly, as she did sometimes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
when her poor back didn’t hurt, and her
head didn’t ache. The sweet, lingering sound
seemed to pervade the summer air. She could
see the time-worn wagon, the rug made of odds
and ends, that they had both considered such a
great achievement. There was the sweet, pallid
face, not quite as it had looked in those last days,
but resembling more the beautiful picture that had
gone to the flames, the crown of golden hair, the
mysterious, fathomless eyes, with a new knowledge
in them, that Dil felt had not been garnered
in that old, pinched life.
</p>
<p>
Her own soul was suddenly informed with a
mysterious rapture. She knew nothing of the
Incarnation, of the love that came down and
tasted pain and anguish, that others, in the suffering
laid upon them, might also know of the joy of
redemption. At that moment Dilsey Quinn was
not far from the kingdom.
</p>
<p>
“O Bess! can’t you come back?” she cried in
a breathless, entreating manner, her eyes luminous
with the rare insight of faith, the evidence of
things unseen. “O Bess, you must be somewhere!
I don’t b’leve you died jes’ like other
folks! Can’t you come back an’ tell me how it
happened, ’cause I know you wouldn’t have gone
and leaved me free of your own will?”
</p>
<p>
A tremendous longing surged at Dil’s heart,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
and almost swept her away. Her breath came in
gasps, her heart beat in great bounds, and then
well nigh stopped. She was suddenly attuned to
spiritual influences in that sweet, solemn solitude.
Was it really Bess’s voice in the softly penetrative
summer air—was the strange, shadowy presence,
so near that she could reach out and touch
it—almost—that of the child?
</p>
<p>
She sat there rapt, motionless, seeing nothing
with her mortal eyes; but in that finer illumination
Bess moved slowly toward her, not walking,
but floating, veiled in a soft, cloud-like drapery,
stretching out her small, white hands. Dil took
them, and they were not cold. She glanced into
the starry eyes, and for moments that was
enough.
</p>
<p>
“O Bess!” in the softest, tenderest whisper,
“if you was in heaven I couldn’t touch you, you’d
be so far away. An’ it’s so sweet. But how did
it all happen?”
</p>
<p>
“When <em>he</em> comes, an’ I ’most know now that he
will come soon, Bess, dear, he c’n tell me how to
go to where you are—waitin’, an’ we’ll start.
There’s somethin’ I don’t know ’bout, an’ can’t get
straight. I never was real smart at ketchin’ hold;
but it’s so beautiful to remember that his Lord
Jesus took little children in his arms. An’ mebbe
he’s took you up out o’ the place they buried you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
an’ is keepin’ you safe. You ain’t there in the
ground—you must be ris’ up some way—”
</p>
<p>
The very birds sang of an unknown land in
their songs; the wind murmuring gently through
the trees thrilled her with an unutterable certainty.
Her slow-moving eyes seemed to penetrate
the very sky. Clear over the edge of the
horizon it almost opened in its glory, as when
Christiana was entering in; and she felt certain
now that she should walk through its starry gates
with Bess’s little hand held tight in hers.
</p>
<p>
“O Bess, I c’n hardly wait for him to come!
Seems as if I must fly away to where you be, but
Patsey an’ all the boys are so good to me. Seems
if I never had such lovely quiet, an’ no one to
scold ner bang my poor head. But I want you so,
Bess—”
</p>
<p>
She stretched out her hands, but the sweet form
seemed to float farther off.
</p>
<p>
“O Bess, don’t go away,” she pleaded.
</p>
<p>
If the seers and the prophets saw heaven in
their rapt visions, why not this poor starved little
one whose angel always beheld the face of the
Father in heaven. She was too ignorant to seize
upon the truths of immortal life, but they thrilled
through every pulse. She had no power of grasping
any but the simplest beliefs, but she knew
some love and care had sheltered Bess. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
dawning of a knowledge that held in its ineffable
beauty and sacredness the truths of resurrection
penetrated her in a mysterious sense, aroused
a faith that she could not yet comprehend; but it
gave her a strange peace.
</p>
<p>
Her life had been a little machine out of which
so much work must be steadily ground. It had
needed all her attention. And Bess had taken all
her love. But in the solitude and sense of loss
she was learning to think.
</p>
<p>
Dil was startled when she saw the boys straggling
along irregularly. How large and strong
Patsey was growing! And how nice Owen
looked in his clean summer suit! Oh, where was
little Dan? She hoped he was happy, and had
enough to eat and some time to play.
</p>
<p>
They were a hungry lot. The great pile of
sandwiches disappeared in a trice. And the cake
that an artist in cook-books might have disdained,
the boys believed beat anything the best baker
could turn out. There had never been any treat
quite up to the cake. Of course the stew was
more “fillin’” when one was tearing hungry, and
cake was a luxury to their small income, but, oh,
what a delight!
</p>
<p>
“You don’t eat nothin,” said Patsey, studying
Dil anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“But I’ve rested so much. And I feel so
happy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
</p>
<p>
There was a divine light shining in her eyes,
and it touched the boy’s soul.
</p>
<p>
“Dil, ef it wosn’t fer them ere freckles right
acrost yer nose, an’ you wos a little fatter, you’d
be jes’ as pooty as they make ’em. Youse growed
real han’some, only you want some red cheeks.”
</p>
<p>
Dil colored at the praise. Did a light shine in
her face because she had seen Bess? She would
like to tell Patsey all about it. Yes, she had
really seen her, but it was all infolded in mystery.
How could she make it plain?
</p>
<p>
The boys ate up every crumb, and seasoned
their repast with much merry jesting. Then they
wanted to go on again. Wasn’t Dil rested enough
to go to the Museum?
</p>
<p>
It was a long walk, and after they entered Dil
was glad to sit down. She looked at the curious
white marble people, and asked Patsey if “they
was truly people or dead folks.” Shorty said “it
was the mummies who were dead folks;” but Dil
shuddered at the thought of Bess being like that.
There were so many curious things, beautiful
things, that the child was bewildered.
</p>
<p>
“’Tain’t so nice as out o’ doors,” said Fin.
“There’s somethin’ in the trees an’ flowers, an’
them places that are so still an’ quiet like, that
stirs a feller all up.”
</p>
<p>
Rough and unlearned as they were, nature
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
appealed to them powerfully. Ah, what a day
it was!
</p>
<p>
“I’ve never had but just one time in my life
that was so lovely,” said Dil with sweet gratefulness:
“an’ that wasn’t so beautiful, only strange.
If anybody was so runnin’ over full o’ happiness
all the time, ’pears to me it would kinder choke
them all round the heart, so’s they couldn’t live.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t know ’bout that,” and Patsey chuckled.
“Happy people ain’t dyin’ off no faster’n other
people, an’ don’t commit suicide so easy. But,
golly! ’twould take a good deal to fill a feller up
chock full o’ happiness, ’cause it’s suthin’ like ice-cream,
keeps meltin’ down all the time, ’n’ youse
can pack in some more.”
</p>
<p>
“I jes’ wish we had some now!” cried Owen,
referring to the cream.
</p>
<p>
“It’s been—well—super splacious! There
ain’t no word long ernuff to hold all’s been crowded
in this ere day,” cried Fin enthusiastically. “Say,
boys, why don’t we come agin? Only ther’s music
days—an golly! I jes’ wish I had lots of money an’
a vacation. Vacations ain’t no good when you
don’t have money.”
</p>
<p>
Dil enjoyed their pleasure. She was so strangely
happy. She had seen Bess, and some time the
puzzle would be explained. She had taken her
first lesson in faith, and she felt light and joyous,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
as if she could fly. The very air was full of
expectation.
</p>
<p>
It was time to return, unless, indeed, they had
brought their suppers along. Dil appreciated the
long ride home. She was very tired, but the joy
within buoyed her up.
</p>
<p>
There was the rather well-gleaned ham bone
and a dish of potatoes for supper, and the last of
the wonderful cake, which they stretched out, and
made to go all around. And they seasoned the
supper with jests and pleasant laughs, and plans
of what they would do, and hopes of being rich
some day. Dil listened and smiled. They were
all so good to her!
</p>
<p>
When they were through, Patsey began to pile
up the dishes and carry them to the sink. He
often did this for Dil, and none of the boys dared
chaff him. She rose presently.
</p>
<p>
The room, the very chair on which she rested
her hand, seemed slipping away. All the air was
full of feathery blue clouds. There was a curious
rushing sound, a great light, a great darkness, and
Dil was a little heap on the floor, white as any
ghost.
</p>
<p>
Patsey picked her up in his arms, and screamed
as only a boy can scream,—
</p>
<p>
“Run quick for some one. Dil’s dead!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>XIII—THE LAND OF PURE DELIGHT</h2>
<p>
Owen started out of the door in a great fright.
Mrs. Wilson was strolling in her yard, and the boy
called to her. There was a side gate that led out
in the alley-way. She came through quickly,
although she had held very much aloof from
these undesirable neighbors.
</p>
<p>
They had laid Dil on the lounge, stuffed anew
and covered with bright cretonne. Patsey looked
at her, wild-eyed.
</p>
<p>
“I think she has only fainted. My sister faints
frequently.” She began to chafe Dil’s hands, and
asked them to wet the end of the towel, with
which she bathed the small white face, and the
brown eyes opened with a smile, a little startled at
the stranger bending over her. She closed them
again; and Mrs. Wilson nodded to the intensely
eager faces crowding about, saying assuringly,—
</p>
<p>
“She will be all right presently.”
</p>
<p>
Then she glanced around the room. It was
clean, and it had some pretty “gift pictures”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
tacked up on the whitewashed wall. There was
a bowl of flowers on the window-sill. The table
had a red and white cloth, there were some Chinese
napkins, and cheap but pretty dishes. The long
towel hanging by the sink was fairly sweet in its
cleanliness, and this pale little girl was the housekeeper!
</p>
<p>
“Have you ever fainted before? What had
you been doing?” she asked in a quiet manner.
</p>
<p>
“We’d been up to Cent’l Park. It was so beautiful!
But I guess I got tired out,” and Dil smiled
faintly. “You see, I was in the hospital in the
spring, an’ I ain’t so strong’s I used to be. But
I feel all well now.”
</p>
<p>
“Youse jes’ lay still there, ’n’ Owny, ’n’ me’ll
wash up the dishes.”
</p>
<p>
Patsey colored scarlet as he said this, but he
stood his ground manfully.
</p>
<p>
“They’re so good to me!” and Dil looked up
into her visitor’s eyes with such heartsome gratitude
that the lady was deeply touched. “Patsey,”
she added, “you’ve got on your best clo’es, ’n’ I
wish you’d tie on that big apern. Mrs. Wilson
won’t make fun, I know.”
</p>
<p>
“No, my child; I shall honor him for his carefulness,”
returned Mrs. Wilson.
</p>
<p>
Patsey’s face grew redder, if such a thing was
possible, but he tied on the apron.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span>
</p>
<p>
“I ought to have been more neighborly,” began
Mrs. Wilson, with a twinge of conscience. “I’ve
watched you all so long, and you have all improved
so much since old Mrs. Brown was here! But
everybody seems so engrossed with business!”
</p>
<p>
“That’s along o’ Dil,” put in Patsey proudly.
“When Dil come things was diff’rent. Dil’s got
so many nice ways—she allis had.”
</p>
<p>
“Is your mother dead?”
</p>
<p>
Dil’s face was full of scarlet shame and distress,
but she could not tell a wrong story.
</p>
<p>
“Her mother ain’t no good,” declared Patsey,
in his stout championship; for he did not quite
like to tell a lie, himself, to the lady, and he knew
Dil wouldn’t. “But Dil’s splendid; and Owny,
that’s her brother,” nodding toward him, “is fus’ rate.
We’re keepin’ together; an’ little Dan,
he’s in a home bein’ took keer of.”
</p>
<p>
“O Patsey!” Dil flushed with a kind of
shamefaced pleasure at his praise.
</p>
<p>
“So you be! I ain’t goin’ back on you, never.”
And there was a little gruffness in his voice as is
apt to be the case when a lump rises in a big boy’s
throat. “An’ you couldn’t tell how nice she’s fixed
up the place—’twas jes’ terrible when she come.”
</p>
<p>
“But you all helped,” returned Dil.
</p>
<p>
“And you are all so much cleaner and nicer,”
and their visitor smiled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes; we’m gittin’ quite tony.” Patsey slung
out the dishcloth and hung it up, and spread the
towel on a bar across the window. Fin and
Shorty edged their way out, and Fossett settled to
a story paper. Owny wanted to go with the boys,
but he compromised by sitting in the doorway.
</p>
<p>
“There is a little child here through the week,
and I’ve seen a baby. My child, you are not
compelled to care for them, are you?”
</p>
<p>
“We didn’t want her to,” protested Patsey; “but
you see, there was another pooty little thing, her
sister Bess, who was hurted ’n’ couldn’t walk, ’n’
Dil took care of her. ’N’ las’ winter she died,
’n’ Dil’s been kinder broodin’ over it ever sence.
We wos off all day, ’n’ she got lonesome like; but
she ain’t gonter have ’em any more, ’cause she
ain’t strong, ’n’ we kin take keer of her,” proudly.
</p>
<p>
“You look as if you ought to be taken care of
altogether for a while.”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wilson studied the pale little face. It
had a curious waxen whiteness like a camellia.
The eyes were large and wistful, but shining in
tender gratitude; the brows were finely pencilled;
the hair was growing to more of a chestnut tint,
and curled loosely about her forehead. She was
strangely pretty now, with the pathetic beauty
that touches one’s heart.
</p>
<p>
“Tell yer wot, Dil, us fellers’ll chip in an’
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
save up a bit ’n’ send youse off to the country like
the ’ristocrockery. You don’t happen to know of
some nice, cheapish place?” and Patsey glanced
questioningly at the visitor.
</p>
<p>
“There are very nice places where it doesn’t
cost anything. Country people often take children
for a fortnight or so. My daughters went to
a beautiful seaside place last summer that a rich
lady fitted up for clerks and shop-girls. Of course
they are older than you, young ladies, but—let
me think a bit—”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wilson had never known much besides
poverty. Youth, married life, and widowhood had
been a struggle. She hired the whole front house,
and rented furnished rooms to young men whose
incomes would not afford luxurious accommodations.
Her sister was in poor health; her two
girls were in stores. Her son, who should have
been her mainstay and comfort, was in an insane
asylum, the result of drink and excesses.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t remember, but I must have heard my
girls talking about places where they take ‘little
mothers,’—the children who tend babies, and give
them a lovely holiday in a beautiful country place,
where they can run about the green fields and
pick flowers and play and sing, or sit about and
have nothing to do. I will try to learn something
about them.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t b’leve I could go ’way,” said Dil,
with soft-toned doubtfulness.
</p>
<p>
“I wish you’d talk her out’n havin’ any babies.
She ain’t no ways strong ’nuff. An’ we boys kin
take keer o’ her. She airns her livin’ over ’n’
over agin. She’s had ’nuff to do wid kids all
her life,” protested her champion.
</p>
<p>
“But Nelly’s so sweet, and ’companies me so
much,” Dil said longingly.
</p>
<p>
“But you orter be chirkin’ up a bit, ’stead er
gittin’ so thin, an’ faintin’. ’Twas nawful, Dil.
You looked jes’ ’s if youse wos dead.”
</p>
<p>
“It didn’t hurt any, Patsey;” and she smiled
over to him. "’Twas queer like ’s if all the bells
in the world was ringin’ soft an’ sweet, an’ then
you went sailin’ off. ’Twas worse when I went
to ketch my breath afterward. But I’m all right
now.”
</p>
<p>
She glanced up smilingly to Mrs. Wilson, who
took the soft little hands in hers, for soft they
were in spite of the hard work they had done.
Patsey had whisked the table up to the side of
the room and brushed up the crumbs. Then he
sat down and watched Dil.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wilson said she must go in home, but she
would run over in the morning. Patsey expressed
his thanks in a frank, boyish manner, and Dil’s
eyes said at least half of hers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
Then Mrs. Brian and her husband returned,
and she stopped to hear what kind of a picnic
they had had. Between the three they told all
the story and the fright.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; she must give up all but Nelly, for her
mother wouldn’t know how to stand it on such
a short notice. The child achilly cries for you on
Sundays, her mother told me. But we can’t have
you killed for any babies in the land,” said Mrs.
Brian emphatically.
</p>
<p>
“That’s the talk!” exclaimed Patsey.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I feel jes’ as well as ever, an’ all rested
like,” and Dil sat up, smiling. “We walked so
much to-day, but to-morrow I’ll be all right.”
</p>
<p>
She seemed quite right the next morning.
When Mrs. Brian’s “man” had gone, she came
in and helped Dil with the breakfast things. Mrs.
Cairns <em>would</em> leave her baby for the half-day, and
Nelly came. Mrs. Wilson looked in upon her,
with a bit of sewing in her hand. Dil did not try
to do anything besides entertain the little ones.
How sweet and naturally she did it!
</p>
<p>
But she was so tired she lay on the lounge a
long while in the afternoon. Nelly played about,
and talked in her pretty broken fashion. Dil
dreamed of the vision she had seen.
</p>
<p>
About five Mrs. Wilson came in, her thin face
lighted with eagerness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
</p>
<p>
“I must tell you something quite delightful,”
she began. “I sew for several ladies; and one of
them, a Miss Lawrence, came in about an hour
ago. She’s interested in several charities, and I
asked her about the places where they sent poor
tired children to recruit. My dear, she is on the
committee of a society; and they have a beautiful
large country-house, where they can take in from
twenty to thirty children. There’s a housekeeper
and nurses, and different young ladies go up to
stay a week or two at a time. They read to the
children, and take them out in the woods, and help
them at playing games; and there are music and
singing, and great shady trees to sit under, and a
barn full of new-mown hay, where they can play
and tumble. Why, it made me wish I was a little
girl!”
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Wilson put her hand on her side, for she
had talked herself out of breath.
</p>
<p>
Dil’s eyes shone with delight. She could see it
all in a vivid manner.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Lawrence couldn’t stay to-day; but she
is coming to-morrow morning, and wants to see
you. She was so interested in the way all you
children are living here. She’s a lovely woman;
and if there were more like her, who were willing
to pay fair prices for work, the poor would be
much the gainer.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
</p>
<p>
“You’re so good to me! Everybody is now,”
said the child gratefully.
</p>
<p>
Dil thought she hadn’t done much of anything
that day, but she was really afraid to tell Patsey
how tired she felt. He <em>would</em> wash up the dishes.
</p>
<p>
“That’ll be jes’ the daisy, Dil!” he said, when
he heard about Miss Lawrence. “You want some
country air, an’—an’ reel fresh country milk.
An’ don’t you worry. We’ll git along. You jes’
go an’ hev a good time.”
</p>
<p>
Oh, could she go to such a blessed place—like
Central Park all the time?
</p>
<p>
She was quite shy and embarrassed when Miss
Lawrence called. A large, pleasant-looking woman,
with indications of wealth and refinement
that Dil felt at once, and she seemed so much
farther away than Mrs. Wilson. But she questioned
Dil very gently, and drew her out with a
rare art. The pale face and evident weakness
appealed to her,—seemed, indeed, to call for
immediate attention.
</p>
<p>
“I shall put you on our next week’s list,” Miss
Lawrence said with gracious interest. “If any
one ever earned a rest, I think you have. And I
will come in to-morrow evening and talk it over
with your brother and the boys.”
</p>
<p>
The “boys” made themselves scarce, except
Patsey and Owen, although Shorty went and sat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
on Mrs. Brian’s stoop. But Miss Lawrence had
seen boys before, and even ventured on a dainty
bit of slang that won Patsey at once. He was
eager for Dil to go and get some red cheeks like
Owen. It didn’t seem as if the two could be
brother and sister.
</p>
<p>
If Miss Lawrence had seen the sleeping accommodations
she would have been more than
shocked; and yet there were hundreds in the
city not as well housed, and few of the real poor
as tidily kept.
</p>
<p>
“It would be jes’ lovely to go,” admitted Dil,
with curious reluctance. “But a whole week!”
</p>
<p>
“Two weeks!” almost shouted Patsey. “An’
youse’ll come home so fat wid de new milk an’
all, yer clo’es won’t fit yer. We’ll jes’ hev to
make an auction an’ sell em’ second-hand.”
</p>
<p>
“An’ take half the money an buy her some
new ones,” said Owen with a laugh. “T’other
half we’ll put in the bank.”
</p>
<p>
Shorty had come sneaking back, and joined in
the merriment.
</p>
<p>
“’N’ I kin cook purty good, ’n’ wash dishes,”
began Patsey, when Dil interrupted,—
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you will be careful of thim, won’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Careful! I’ll treat ’em as if they was aiggs.
An’ I’ll make the boys stan’ roun’, so’s to keep
the house—well—decent!” and he made a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>
funny, meaning face. “Je-ru-sa-lem! what a hole
we had when youse come! An’ now it’s like a
pallis.”
</p>
<p>
Not like the palace Dil remembered in the
book that had been such a treat to her and Bess.
</p>
<p>
Everybody made it easy for Dil. Mrs. Brian
would see to the boys, and Mrs. Wilson offered to
keep Nelly until her return. Still, it was Friday
before Dil could really make up her mind.
</p>
<p>
On Saturday Dil took Nelly and went up to
Madison Square. The policeman kept out of her
way; he could not bear to face her look of disappointment.
But just at the last she took him
inadvertently.
</p>
<p>
“You see, I’m sure he’ll come soon,” she said
with a confidence that seemed like a presentiment.
“’Cause he’ll be thinkin’ ’bout the Sat’day he
made the picture of Bess an’ me. An’ I want
him to know where I’ve gone; so I’ve writ it out.
I’ve been studyin’ writin’.”
</p>
<p>
“She looks like a ghost,” the man said to himself
as his eyes followed her. “She’s that changed
in a year no one would know her except for her
eyes. If he don’t come soon, he won’t see her at
all, to my thinking. Hillo! what a scheme! I’ll
hunt him up. Why didn’t I think of it before!
John Travis! Seems to me I’ve heard something
about John Travis.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
</p>
<p>
Sunday was a soft, cloudy day, with a touch of
rain. Every boy stayed at home—you couldn’t
have driven them away. They promised to give
Mrs. Brian the rent every night, so as to be provided
for next Monday. They sang some of their
prettiest songs for her; they didn’t know many
hymns, but they had a spirit of tenderest devotion
in their hearts.
</p>
<p>
The boys said good-by to her the next morning
in a rather sober fashion. Patsey and Owen were
going to take her to the ferry. Mrs. Brian brought
down her satchel, and Dil put in her white dress,
some aprons, and various small matters. She was
to wear her best pink gingham. Mrs. Wilson was
full of hope, Mrs. Brian extremely jolly, and
was sure Barnum would want her for a “fat girl”
when she came back.
</p>
<p>
Dil’s similitudes were very limited, but Cinderella
and the fairy godmother <em>did</em> come into her
mind.
</p>
<p>
Miss Lawrence was in the waiting-room with
half a dozen girls. She came and greeted Dil
cordially, and told her she looked better already.
The child’s eyes brightened with a sunny light.
</p>
<p>
Owen said good-by in a boy’s awkward fashion,
and gave her the bag. Patsey was reluctant, and
he turned slowly away.
</p>
<p>
Then he came back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
</p>
<p>
“Good-by, Dil, dear,” he said again with deep
tenderness as he stooped to kiss her. He was so
much taller, though only a few months older.
And always Patsey Muldoon was glad he came
back for that kiss.
</p>
<p>
Then Miss Lawrence bought tickets and ushered
her small procession, nine of them now, through
the narrow way and out on the boat. They huddled
together at first like a flock of sheep. Dil
noticed one little hump-backed girl, who had large,
light eyes and golden hair in ringlets. She was
not like Bess, and yet she moved Dil’s sympathetic
heart. Had a drunken father “hurted
her”?
</p>
<p>
She felt shy of the others, they all seemed in
such spirits. As they were going off the boat,
she drew nearer the unfortunate child and longed
to speak.
</p>
<p>
An impudent leer crossed the other face.
</p>
<p>
“Who yer lookin’ at? Mind yer own biz. I’m
jes’ as good as youse!” was the unexpected salutation.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Dil meekly, her enthusiastic
pity quenched.
</p>
<p>
Dil’s seat was in the window end, and her companion
a stolid little German with two flaxen tails
down her back. So she sat quite still. The
morning had been so full of excitement she could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
hardly think. She had been just whirled about,
pushed into the adventure.
</p>
<p>
But the “little mothers” interested her. Did
they like babies, she wondered? Did their arms
ache, and were their backs strained and tired
carrying them about? Most of them were thin
and weary looking, yet they were in gay spirits,
making little jokes and giving quick, slangy answers,
ready to laugh at anything.
</p>
<p>
Dil seemed quite apart from them. They passed
through a tunnel, and there were little shrieks and
giggles. The German girl caught Dil’s arm. Then
they crossed rivers, passed pretty towns, bits of
woods, flower gardens, long fields of waving corn,
meadows where daisies still lingered, and tufts of
red clover looked like roses. Ah, how large the
world was! And maybe heaven was a great deal
farther off than she and Bess had imagined. They
might have been all winter going if they had
walked. She felt suddenly thankful that John
Travis had advised against it.
</p>
<p>
It was Dilsey Quinn’s first railroad journey,
and it gave her the sensation of flying. She had
brightened up, and a soft flush toned the paleness.
An indescribable light hovered about her
face, the rapt look that we term spiritual.
</p>
<p>
They trooped out of the train,—it seemed a
week since they had started, her brain was so full
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
of beautiful impressions. A young lady had come
down to meet them, and walked with Miss Lawrence.
The children were wild with the newness
of everything; some of them had not even seen
the nearest park before. They chased butterflies;
they longed to chase the birds; they ran
and laughed, and presently came to a great white
house set in an old orchard.
</p>
<p>
“Children,” said Miss Lawrence, “here is your
new home. You can run and play to your heart’s
content. In the woods yonder you can shout and
be as wild as you like. But you must come in
first and take off your best dresses. And now
you must mind when you are spoken to, and not
quarrel with each other.”
</p>
<p>
They went through a wide hall and up an old-fashioned
staircase. Three large rooms were full
of narrow white-draped cots. The girls who
pushed on ahead were given numbers to correspond.
There were pegs for their hats and garments,
a shelf for their satchels and bundles.
What a whispering, chattering, and giggling!
Here was a bath-room, and basins for washing.
And then the bell rang for dinner.
</p>
<p>
Oh, what a dinner it was to most of the newcomers!
A great slice of sweet boiled beef, vegetables,
and bread in an unstinted fashion, and a
harvest apple for dessert. Dil was too full of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
rapture to eat, and she let the next girl, whose
capacity seemed unlimited, have most of her
dinner.
</p>
<p>
Afterward they went out to play. Hammocks
and swings were everywhere. They ran and
shouted. They sat in the grass, and laughed
with a sense of improbable delight. No one to
scold, no work to do, not to be beaten for a
whole long week! Oh, what joy it was to these
little toilers in courts and slums and foul tenement
houses!
</p>
<p>
Dil sat on a seat built around a great tree, and
watched them. She was like one in a dream,
quite apart from them. There is a delightful,
unquestioning freemasonry among children. The
subtle sign is given in a word or look or smile,
and they are all kin. But it had been so long
since Dil was a child, that she had forgotten
the language.
</p>
<p>
She was not unhappy nor solitary. She was
simply beyond playing, far from boisterous mirth.
She had been doing a woman’s work so long, and
childhood for the poor is ever a brief season.
</p>
<p>
Two or three girls shyly asked her to play
“tag.” She gently shook her head. Then a
long-ago sound caught her attention.
</p>
<p>
Two little girls were holding their clasped
hands up as high as they could stretch. A small
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
procession passed, each girl holding to the skirt
of the other, and singing:—
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Open&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;gates&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;high&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;let&nbsp;&nbsp;King&nbsp;&nbsp;George&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;his&nbsp;&nbsp;men&nbsp;&nbsp;go&nbsp;&nbsp;by.<br />
&#160;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needle’s&nbsp;&nbsp;eye&nbsp;&nbsp;as&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;pass&nbsp;&nbsp;by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awaiting&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;&nbsp;go&nbsp;&nbsp;through;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;lass&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp;let&nbsp;&nbsp;pass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&nbsp;&nbsp;now&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;have&nbsp;&nbsp;caught&nbsp;&nbsp;you.”<br />
</p>
<p>
Down came the arms of the “gates” over the
head of the girl just under them. There was a
shriek and a giggle. Then the one who was
caught had to be a “gate,” and so it went on.
</p>
<p>
Dil looked, fascinated with a kind of remembered
terror. It seemed as if she must have
heard that in another world, it was so long, long
ago. Before Bess was “hurted,” when Dan was
a chubby baby, she had them both out, caring
for them. At least, Dan was in the corner of the
stoop, and Bess was tossing a ball for his amusement.
A group of girls were playing this very
game. The arms came down and took Dilsey
Quinn prisoner, and all laughed because she had
been so quick to evade them.
</p>
<p>
Something else—her mother’s heavy hand that
dragged Dil out of the ring. The girls scattered,
afraid of the tall, strong virago. Dil picked up
the baby and took Bess by the hand. They were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
not living in Barker’s Court then. She shuddered,
for she knew what awaited her. She should have
been in the house, getting supper, to be sure.
She had not meant to play so long, and even then
she so seldom played.
</p>
<p>
Poor Dil! For a fortnight or so she carried
the marks on her body.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tache ye to be wastin’ of yer time foolin’
wid sich,” said her mother.
</p>
<p>
Then Bess was “hurted,” and her mother ill in
bed for weeks. They were warned out of the
house, and for some time it was hard lines for
them all. Dil never played any more. Childhood
was at an end for her.
</p>
<p>
And when she heard the merry voices here, a
cold, terrible shiver came over her with the old
memories. Was it softened by the thought that
Bess could run about then? But even little
Bess had sometimes been cruelly beaten. After
that—was there a strange comfort that had never
come before, that Bess’s accident had saved her
many an unreasonable punishment? For Mrs.
Quinn had let the poor little sufferer pretty much
alone. Dil had managed to stand between, and
take the blows and ill usage.
</p>
<p>
Does God note all the vicarious suffering in the
world, and write it in the book of remembrance?
</p>
<p>
Dil turned her head away. Another party were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span>
playing “Ring a round a rosy.” And a group on
the grass were being inducted into the mystery of
“Jacks.” She wondered a little where her mother
was. She did not want to see her, but she hoped
matters were better with her. Surely she need
not work so hard. And oh, if she would not
drink gin! But Dil had noted the fact that most
women did as they grew older.
</p>
<p>
Miss Lawrence came out presently with a
bright cheery word for them all.
</p>
<p>
“You’re not playing,” she said to Dil. “You
must run about and have some fun, and get some
color in your cheeks. And you must not sit and
brood over your hard life. That is all passed, and
we hope the good Father has something better
in store. And you must be friendly with the
others.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes’m,” answered Dil, with soft pathos.
“Only I’d rather sit here an’ look on.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t get homesick after your boys,” and the
lady’s smile went to Dil’s heart. “You’ll feel less
strange to-morrow. I want this outing to be of
real benefit to you. I’m going down to the city
now, and will see Mrs. Wilson. When I come
again I’ll bring you some word from the boys. I
am sure everything will be done for your comfort.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes’m,” Dil answered meekly, but with an
uplifted smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p>
Several little girls ran and kissed her a rapturous
good-by. When Dil saw her go out of the
gate she felt strangely alone. She wanted to fly
home to the boys, to get their supper, to listen
to their merry jests and adventures, to see their
bright eyes gleam, and hear the glad laughter.
She felt so rested. Oh, if she had <em>not</em> promised
Patsey to stay a whole long week. And one day
was not yet gone.
</p>
<p>
She espied a vacant hammock, and stole lightly
out from her leafy covert to take possession. It
was odd, but the little hump-backed girl seemed
a centre of attraction. She said so many droll,
amusing things. She was pert and audacious to
be sure. She could talk broken Dutch and the
broadest Irish, and sing all the street songs. The
children were positively fascinated with her. A
wonder came to Dil as to how it would feel to
be so enthusiastically admired.
</p>
<p>
She lay there swinging to and fro until the supper
bell rang long and loud. One of the attendants
came and talked with her while the children
were tripping in from the woods. Something in
her appearance and gentle manner reminded Dil
of the hospital nurse.
</p>
<p>
There was a good deal of singing in the evening,
but they all went to bed early. How wonderfully
quiet it was! No dogs barking, no marauding cats
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
wauling dismally on back fences, no rattle and whiz
of “L” cars, no clatter of heavy wagons. And
oh, the wonderful sweetness in the air! If Dil
had ever achieved Bible reading, she would have
thought of “songs in the night” and a “holy solemnity,”
but she could feel the things unutterable.
</p>
<p>
The window was next to her bed. She sat up
and watched the ships of fleece go drifting by.
How the great golden stars twinkled! Were they
worlds? and did people live in them? They made
a mysterious melody; and though she had not
heard of the stars singing for joy, she felt it in
every pulse with a sweet, solemn thrill of rapture.
</p>
<p>
Was that heaven back of the shining stars?
And oh! would she and Bess and John Travis be
together there? For he would help her to call
back Bess, as she came on Sunday. It was
only a little while to wait now. She felt the
assurance—for the poor ignorant little girl had
translated St. Paul’s sublime, “By faith.”
</p>
<p>
The moon silvered the tree-tops, and presently
sent one slant ray across the bed. Dil laid her
hands in it with a trance of ecstasy. The delicious
state of quietude seemed to make her a part
of all lovely, heavenly things. It was the “land
of pure delight” that John Travis sang about.
A whole line came back to her,—
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“And&nbsp;&nbsp;pleasures&nbsp;&nbsp;banish&nbsp;&nbsp;pain.”<br />
</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span></div>
<p>
Dilsey Quinn had attained to the spiritual
pleasures. Pain was not, could not be again.
</p>
<p>
She was not a bit sleepy. She watched the
moon dropping down and down. All the insects
had stopped. A soft darkness seemed spread over
everything, and by dozens the stars went out.
Ah, how wonderful it all was! If people could
only have chances to know!
</p>
<p>
“My child,” said Miss Mary at the breakfast
table, “you are not eating anything! Don’t you
like porridge, and this nice milk?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it’s so good,” replied Dil gratefully.
“An’ the milk seems almost as if ’twas full of
roses, it’s so sweet. But I can’t get hungry as I
used, an’ when I eat just a little I seem all filled
up.”
</p>
<p>
“Would you like bread better? And some nice
creamed potatoes?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want nothin’ more.” Dil looked up
with a soft light in her eyes. “Mebbe by noon
I’ll be hungry—I most know I will.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I hope so.”
</p>
<p>
It was such a long morning to Dil, so hard to
sit round and do nothing. If there had been a
baby to tend, or a room to tidy. She would have
been glad to go to the kitchen and help prepare
the vegetables. She was so used to work that
she could not feel at home in idleness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
</p>
<p>
She went over to the woods with the children
to please Miss Mary, who suggested it so gently.
But some feeling—the long disuse of childhood—held
her aloof. She could not join in their plays,
but it was a pleasure to watch them. And how
wonderful the woods were! The soft grasses
with feathery heads, the mosses, some of them
with tiny red blossoms not as large as a pin’s
head. There were a few wild flowers left, and
long trails of clematis wandering about; shining
bitter-sweet, green chestnut burrs in clusters, the
long, fringy blossoms in yellow brown still holding
on to some of them. There were bunches of little
fox grapes, too bitter and sour for even children
to eat.
</p>
<p>
She sat down on a stone and almost held her
breath. It was the real, every-day country, not
Central Park. The birds sang at their own sweet
will, and made swift dazzles in the sunshine as
they flew from tree to tree. Could heaven be
any better? But there was no pain nor sickness
nor weariness in heaven. And she felt so strangely
tired at some moments.
</p>
<p>
She used her utmost endeavors to eat some
dinner. It had such an appetizing flavor. The
little girl next to her, who had swallowed her supper
so quickly last night, eyed it longingly.
</p>
<p>
“You can have the potato and the meat,” Dil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
whispered softly. That travelled down red lane,
and still seemed to leave a hollow behind. It was
like the hungry boys at home, and she smiled.
</p>
<p>
She sat under the tree again, and Miss Mary
tried to persuade her to go and play, but she was
gently obstinate.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Lawrence asked me specially to look
after her,” she said to another of the attendants.
“She looks like a little ghost; but whether she
is really ill, or only dead tired out, I can’t decide.
It’s so natural for children to want to play, but
she doesn’t seem to care to do anything but mope.
Yet she speaks up so cheerful.”
</p>
<p>
“Poor children! How hard some of their lives
are,” and her companion sighed.
</p>
<p>
Dil’s supper tasted good; and she was so sorry
she couldn’t eat more, as she glanced up and
caught Miss Mary’s eye.
</p>
<p>
“I’m ever so much better,” she said in her soft,
bright manner. “I’m glad; for the boys wanted
me to get well an’ fat, an’ have red cheeks. I’ll
try my best, you’re all so good. An’ it’s such a
beautiful place. I wonder what made—some one—think
’bout the little mothers? But the babies
ought to be here too.”
</p>
<p>
“That wouldn’t give the little mothers much
rest. Are there many babies in your family?”
</p>
<p>
“There ain’t any, but—but some that come in.
Other people’s babies.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
</p>
<p>
“And does your mother keep a nursery?”
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t got any mother now. I took the
babies ’cause I liked them.”
</p>
<p>
“But where do you live?”
</p>
<p>
“With my brother an’—an’ the boys. I keep
house.”
</p>
<p>
How unchildishly reticent she seemed. And
most of the children were ready to tell everything.
</p>
<p>
The little household was called in for their
evening singing.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>XIV—VIRGINIA DEERING</h2>
<p>
Wednesday’s visitor was a tall, slim girl with
an abundance of soft, light hair, that fell in loose
waves and dainty little curls. Her gown was so
pretty, a sort of grayish-blue china silk with clusters
of flowers scattered here and there. Her
wide-brimmed, gray chip hat was just a garden of
crushed roses, that looked as if they might shake
off.
</p>
<p>
There was a charm about her, for the children
who had seen her the week before ran to her with
joyful exclamations. They kissed her white hands,
they caught hold of her gown, and presently she
dropped on the grass and they all huddled about
her. She told them a story, very amusing it must
have been, they laughed so. Sadie Carr, the little
deformed girl, seemed to lay instant claim to her.
</p>
<p>
Dil had a strange, homesick yearning to-day.
She longed so to see the boys. Her eyes overflowed
with tears as she thought of them and
their warm, vital love. She seemed almost to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
have lost Bess. Could she see her again at Cent’l
Park she wondered? She would ask Patsey to
take her there as soon as she went home.
</p>
<p>
A great hay wagon had come and taken a load
of the children down to the meadows. Three
were in disgrace for being naughty, and had to
spend an hour sitting on the stoop. Some were
reading. The German girl was crocheting.
</p>
<p>
Dil sat out under the old branching apple-tree,
whose hard red apples would be delightful along
in the autumn. She was counting up the days.
To-night they would be half gone. Would they
let her go on Saturday she wondered? She looked
at her poor little hands—they hadn’t grown any
fat.
</p>
<p>
“Who is that little girl? and why does she keep
apart from the others?” asked Miss Deering.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. She seems strange and hard to
get on with. But she looks so weakly that even
sitting still may do her good. Go and see what
you can make of her, Miss Virginia.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Deering had several roses in her hand.
She sauntered slowly down to Dil, and dropped
the roses in her lap on the thin white hands.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, thank you!” Dil exclaimed gravely. She
did not pick them up with the enthusiasm Miss
Deering expected.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you care for flowers?” Miss Deering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253'></a>253</span>
seated herself beside the quiet child, and studied
the face turned a little from her.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I like thim so much,” glancing at them
with a curiously absent air. Her manner was so
formal and old-fashioned, and she roused a sense
of elusiveness that puzzled the young lady.
</p>
<p>
“I think I must have seen you before. I can’t
just remember—”
</p>
<p>
Dil raised her soft brown eyes, lustrous still
with the tears of longing that were in them a moment
ago. The short curved upper lip, the tumbled
hair, the gravely wondering expression—how
curiously familiar it seemed.
</p>
<p>
“I hope you are happy here?” she said gently.
</p>
<p>
“I like it better home,” Dil returned, but with
no emphasis of ungraciousness. “I’m used to the
boys, ’n’ they’re so good to me. But they wanted
me to come an’ get well. I wasn’t reel sick only—Patsey
don’t like me to look like a skiliton, he
says. Everybody here’s so nice.”
</p>
<p>
“And who is Patsey—your brother?”
</p>
<p>
She seemed to study Virginia Deering in her
turn. It was a proud face, yet soft and tender,
friendly. It touched the reticent little soul.
</p>
<p>
“No; Owen’s my brother. There’s some more
boys, an’ we keep house. Patsey is—Patsey’s
alwers been good to me an’ Bess.”
</p>
<p>
There was a touching inflection in her tone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254'></a>254</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who is Bess?” with a persuasive entreaty
that found its way to the lonely heart.
</p>
<p>
“Bess is—Bess was”—The voice trembled
and died out. Virginia Deering slipped her arm
about the small figure with a sympathetic nearness.
Dil made another effort.
</p>
<p>
“Bess was my poor little hurted sister. I didn’t
ever have no other one.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you want to tell me about her? I
should so like to hear. How did she get
hurt?”
</p>
<p>
Virginia Deering had of late been taking lessons
in divine as well as human sympathy. She
was willing to begin at the foundation with the
least of these.
</p>
<p>
Dil looked across the sunny field to the shaded,
waving woods. There had never been any one to
whom she could tell all of Bess’s story. Mrs.
Brian, tender and kindly, had not understood. A
helpless feeling came over her.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if she loved roses? Did she ever
have any?” Miss Deering laid her finger on
those in Dil’s hand, then felt under and clasped
the hand itself.
</p>
<p>
Dil was suddenly roused. The grave face
seemed transfigured. Where had she seen it—under
far different auspices?
</p>
<p>
“She had some wild roses wunst. Oh, do you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255'></a>255</span>
know what wild roses is? I looked in the woods
for some yest’day.”
</p>
<p>
Wild roses! She had set herself to bear her
lot, bruised and wrecked in an evil moment, with
all the bravery of true repentance.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” in a soft, constrained tone. “I have
always loved them. And last summer where I
was staying there were hundreds of them.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” cried Dil eagerly, “that was jest what
<em>he</em> said. It was clear away to las’ summer. Patsey
was up to Grand Cent’l deepo’. He carried
bags an’ such. An’ a beautiful young lady gev
him a great bunch. Casey made a grab fer thim,
but Patsey snatched, an’ he’s strongest, ’n’ he gev
it to Casey good till a cop come, ’n’ then he run
all the way to Barker’s Court an’ brought thim to
Bess an’ me.”
</p>
<p>
“A great bunch of wild roses! Oh, then I know
something about Patsey. It was one day in August.
And—and I had the roses.”
</p>
<p>
Dil’s face was a rare study. Virginia Deering
bent over and kissed it. Then the ice of strangeness
was broken, and they were friends.
</p>
<p>
This was Patsey’s “stunner.” She was very
sweet and lovely, with pink cheeks, and teeth like
pearls. Dil looked into the large, serious eyes,
and her heart warmed until she gave a soft, glad,
trusting laugh.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256'></a>256</span>
</p>
<p>
“Patsey’ll be so glad to have me find you!
They were the beautifullest things, withered up
some, but so sweet. Me an’ Bess hadn’t never
seen any; an’ I put them in a bowl of water, an’ all
the baby buds come out, an’ they made Bess so
glad she could a-danced if she’d been well, ’cause
she used to ’fore she was hurted, when the hand-organs
come. They was on the winder-sill by
where she slept, an’ every day we’d take out the
poor dead ones. ’N’ there was jes’ a few Sat’day
when we went up to the Square an’ met the man.
’N’ I allers had to wheel Bess, ’cause she couldn’t
walk.”
</p>
<p>
“What hurt her?”
</p>
<p>
“Well—pappy did. He was dreadful that
night along a-drinkin’, an’ he slammed her against
the wall, an’ her poor little hurted legs never grew
any more. An’ the man said jes’ the same as you,—that
he’d been stayin’ where there was hundreds
of thim, an’ he made the beautifullest picture
of Bess—she was pritty as an angel.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Deering’s eyes fell on the little trail of
freckles across Dil’s nose. They were very small,
but quite distinct on the waxen, pale skin.
</p>
<p>
“And he painted a picture of you! He put
you in that wild-rose dell. I know now. I
thought I must have seen your face.”
</p>
<p>
Dil looked almost stupidly amazed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257'></a>257</span>
</p>
<p>
“Bess was so much prittier,” she said simply.
“<em>Do</em> you know ’bout him? He went away ever
so far, crost the ’Lantic Oshun. But he said he’d
come back in the spring.”
</p>
<p>
She lifted her grave, perplexed eyes to a face
whose wavering tints were struggling with keen
emotion.
</p>
<p>
“He couldn’t come back in the spring. He
went abroad with a cousin who loved him very
much, who was ill, and hoped to get well; but he
grew worse and weaker, and died only a little
while ago. And Mr. Travis came in on Monday,
I think.”
</p>
<p>
Her voice trembled a little.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I knew he would come!” The glad cry
was electrifying.
</p>
<p>
And she, this little being, one among the waifs
of a big city, had looked for him, had a right to
look for him.
</p>
<p>
“He ain’t the kind to tell what he don’t mean.
Bess was so sure. An’ I want to ast him so
many things I can’t get straight by myself. I
ain’t smart like Bess was, an’ we was goin’ to
heaven when he come back; he said he’d go with
us. An’ now Bess is dead.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear little girl,” Virginia held her close,
and kissed the cool, waxen cheek, the pale lips,
“will you tell me all the story, and about going
to heaven?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258'></a>258</span>
</p>
<p>
It was an easy confidence now. She told the
plans so simply, with that wonderful directness
one rarely finds outside of Bible narratives. Her
own share in the small series of tragedies was related
with no consciousness that it had been
heroic. Virginia could see the Square on the
Saturday afternoon, and Bess in her wagon, when
she “ast Mr. Travis to go to heaven with them.”
And the other time—the singing. Ah, she well
knew the beauty and pathos of the voice. How
they had hoped and planned—and that last sad
night, with its remembrance of wild roses. Dil’s
voice broke now and then, and she made little
heart-touching pauses; but Virginia was crying
softly, moved from the depths of her soul. And
Dil’s wonderful faith that she could have brought
Bess back to life bordered on the sublime.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, my dear,” and Virginia’s voice trembled
with tenderness, “you need never doubt. Bess
<em>is</em> in heaven.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” returned Dil, with a curious certainty in
her tone, “she ain’t quite gone, ’cause I’ve seen
her. We all went up to Cent’l Park, Sunday
week ago. I was all alone, the boys goin’ off
walkin’, an’ me bein’ tired. I wanted her so
much, I called to her; an’ she come, all beautiful
an’ well, like <em>his</em> picture of her. I c’n talk to her,
but she can’t answer. There’s a little ketch in it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259'></a>259</span>
I can’t get straight, not bein’ smart like to understand.
But she’s jes’ waitin’ somewheres, ’n’ he
kin tell me how it is. You see, Bess wouldn’t
go to heaven ’thout me, an’ he would know just
where she is. For she couldn’t get crost the
river ’n’ up the pallis steps ’les I had hold of her
hand. For she never had any one to love her
so, ’n’ she wouldn’t go back on me for a whole
world.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Deering could readily believe that. But,
oh, what should she say to this wonderful faith?
Had it puzzled John Travis as well?
</p>
<p>
“And who sent you here?” she asked, to break
the tense strain.
</p>
<p>
Dil told of the fainting spell, and Mrs. Wilson
and Miss Lawrence, who had been so good.
</p>
<p>
“But now he’s come, you see, I must get well
an’ go down. He’ll be there waitin’. I’d like to
stay with the boys, but somethin’ draws me to
Bess. I feel most tore in two. An’ ther’s a
chokin’ in my throat, an’ my head goes round, an’
I can’t hardly wait, I want to see her so. When
I tell Patsey and Owny all about it, I’m most sure
they’ll want me to go, for they know how I loved
Bess. An’ when <em>he</em> comes, he’ll know what’s jes’
right.”
</p>
<p>
They were silent a long while. The bees
crooned about, now and then a bird lilted in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260'></a>260</span>
gladness of his heart. Virginia Deering was asking
herself if she had ever loved like this, and
what she had suffered patiently for her love.
For her self-will and self-love there had been
many a pang. But she let her soul go down now
to the divinest humiliation. Whatever <em>he</em> did
henceforth, even to the dealing out of sorest punishment,
must be right evermore in her eyes.
</p>
<p>
The children were coming back from their ride,
joyous, noisy, exuberant; their eyes sparkling,
their cheeks beginning to color a little with the
vivifying air and pleasurable excitement. Dil
glanced at them with a soft little smile.
</p>
<p>
“I think they want you,” she said. “They
like you so. An’ I like you too, but I’ve had
you all this time.”
</p>
<p>
“You are a generous little girl.” Virginia was
struck by the simple self-abnegation. “I will
come back again presently.”
</p>
<p>
She did not let the noisy group miss anything
in her demeanor. And yet she was thinking of
that summer day, and the poor roses she had
taken so unwillingly. How she had shrunk from
them all through the journey! How she had
tossed them out, poor things, to be fought over
by street arabs. They had come back to her
with healing on their wings. And that John
Travis should have seen them, and the two little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261'></a>261</span>
waifs of unkind fortune. Ah, how could <em>she</em> have
been so fatally blind and cruel that day among
the roses? And all for such a very little thing.
</p>
<p>
What could she say to this simple, trustful
child? If her faith and her beliefs had gone outside
of orthodox lines, for lack of the training all
people are supposed to get in this Christian land,
was there any way in which she could amend it?
No, she could not even disturb it. John Travis
should gather in the harvest he had planted; for,
like Dil, she believed him in sincere earnest. She
“almost knew that he meant to set out on the
journey to heaven,” if not in the literal way poor,
trusting little Dil took it. And she honored him
as she never had before.
</p>
<p>
She came back to Dil for a few moments.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you want to hear about the picture?”
she asked. “It quite went out of my mind. Mr.
Travis exhibited it in London, and a friend bought
it and brought it home. I saw it a fortnight ago.
So you brought him a great deal of good fortune
and money.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m so glad,” her eyes shone with a soul radiance;
“for he gev us some money—it was for
Bess, an’ we buyed such lots of things. We had
such a splendid time! Five dollars—twicet—an’
Mrs. Bolan, an’ she was so glad ’bout the
singin’. But I wisht it had been Bess. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262'></a>262</span>
couldn’t make no such beautiful picture out’n
me. Bess looked jes’ ’s if she could talk.”
</p>
<p>
“He put you in that beautiful thicket of roses.”
Ah, how well he had remembered it! “I do not
think any one would have you changed, but you
were not so thin then.”
</p>
<p>
“No;” Dil gave the soft little laugh so different
from the other children. “I was quite a little
chunk, mammy alwers said, an’ I don’t mind, only
Patsey wants me to get fatter. Mebbe they make
people look beautifuller in pictures,” and she gave
a serious little sigh.
</p>
<p>
Then the supper-bell rang. Dil held tightly to
the slim hand.
</p>
<p>
“They’re all so good,” she said earnestly.
“But folks is diff’rent. Some come clost to you,”
and she made an appealing movement of nearness.
“Then they couldn’t understand ’bout me
an’ Bess—that she’s jes’ waitin’ somewheres till
I kin find out how to go to her, an’ then he’ll tell
us which way to start for heaven. I’m so glad
you know <em>him</em>.”
</p>
<p>
Dil tried again to eat, but did not accomplish
much. She was brimful of joy. Her eyes shone,
and a happy smile kept fluttering about her face,
flushing it delicately.
</p>
<p>
“You have made a new child of her,” said Miss
Mary delightedly. “I thought her a dull and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263'></a>263</span>
unattractive little thing, but such lives as theirs
wear out the charms and graces of childhood
before they have time to bloom. We used to
think the poor had many compensations, and
amongst them health, that richer people went
envying. Would any mother in comfortable circumstances
change her child’s physique for these
stunted frames and half-vitalized brains?”
</p>
<p>
Virginia Deering made some new resolves. It
was not enough to merely feed and clothe. She
thought of Dilsey Quinn’s love and devotion;
of Patsey Muldoon’s brave endeavor to rescue
Owen, and keep him from going to the bad, and
his generosity in providing a home for Dil, to save
her from her brutalized mother. Ah, yes; charity
was a grander thing,—a love for humanity.
</p>
<p>
Dil came to say good-night. Virginia was
startled by the unearthly beauty, the heavenly
content, in her eyes that transfigured her.
</p>
<p>
“You breathe too short and fast,” she said.
“You are too much excited.”
</p>
<p>
“I d’n’ know—I think it’s ’cause <em>he’s</em> comin’.
’N’ I’ve waited so, ’n’ now it’s all light ’n’ beautiful,
’n’ I don’t feel worried no more.”
</p>
<p>
“You must go to sleep and get rested, and—get
well.” Yes, she <em>must</em> get well, and have the
different kind of life Virginia began to plan for
her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264'></a>264</span>
</p>
<p>
A soft rain set in. There was such a tender
patter on the leaves that Dil almost laughed
in sympathetic joy. Such delightful fragrance
everywhere! For a moment she loathed the city,
and it seemed as if she could not go back to the
crowded rooms and close air. But only for a
little while. John Travis would set her on the
road to heaven.
</p>
<p>
It was curious how bits of the hymn came back
to her. She could not have repeated the words
consecutively—it was like the strain of remembered
melody one follows in one’s brain, and yet
cannot give it voice. She seemed actually to <em>see</em> it.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“O’er&nbsp;&nbsp;all&nbsp;&nbsp;those&nbsp;&nbsp;wide&nbsp;&nbsp;extended&nbsp;&nbsp;plains,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shines&nbsp;&nbsp;one&nbsp;&nbsp;eternal&nbsp;&nbsp;day.”<br />
</p>
<p>
Eternal day! and no night. Forever to be
walking about with Bess, when the Lord Jesus
had taken her in his arms and made her like other
children. Oh, did Sadie Carr know that in heaven
she would be straight and nice and beautiful?
She must ask Miss Deering to tell her. Then
her heart went out with trembling, yearning tenderness
toward her mother. Couldn’t the Lord
Jesus do something to keep her from drinking
gin and going up to the Island? Was little Dan
in a happy home like this, with plenty to eat?—boys
were always hungry. She used to be before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265'></a>265</span>
Bess went away, but it seemed as if she should
never be hungry again.
</p>
<p>
The little girls around her were breathing
peacefully. They were still well enough to have
a good time when beneficent fortune favored.
They had run and played and shouted, and were
healthily tired. Dil remembered how sleepy she
used to be when she was crooning songs to Bess.
But since the day at Central Park it had been so
different. The nights were all alight with fancies,
and she was being whirled along in an air
full of music and sweetness.
</p>
<p>
Toward morning it stopped raining. Oh, how
the birds sang at daylight! She dropped off to
sleep then, but presently something startled her.
She was back with the boys, and there was breakfast
to get. She heard the eager voices, and
sprang out of bed, glancing around.
</p>
<p>
It was only the children chattering as they
dressed. Perhaps she looked strange to them,
for one little girl uttered a wild cry as Dil slipped
down on the floor a soft little heap.
</p>
<p>
The nurses thought at first that she was dead,
it was so long before there was any sign of returning
animation, and then it was only to lapse from
one faint to another.
</p>
<p>
“We must have the doctor,” said Miss Mary.
“And we will take her to my room. There are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266'></a>266</span>
three children in the Infirmary, one with a
fever.”
</p>
<p>
The room was not large, but cheerful in aspect.
A tree near by shut out the glare of the sunshine,
and sifted it through in soft, changeful shadows.
</p>
<p>
“She looks like death itself. Poor little girl!
And Miss Lawrence was so interested in her.
Will you mind staying a bit, Miss Virginia?
There are so many things for me to do, and the
doctor will be in soon.”
</p>
<p>
Virginia did not mind. She had been keeping
a vigil through the night. She had taken a pride
in what she called shaping her life on certain
noble lines. How poor and small and ease-loving
to the point of selfishness they looked now!
What could there ever be as simply grand and
tender as Dilsey Quinn’s love for her little sister,
and her cheerful patience with the evils of a hard
and cruel life?
</p>
<p>
She had been in the wrong, she knew it well.
She had waited for him to make an overture; but
he had gone without a word, and that had heightened
her anger. Then had come a bitter sense
of loss, a tender regret deepening into real and
fervent sorrow. Out of it had arisen a nobler
repentance, and acceptance of the result of her
evil moment. She had hoped some time, and in
some unlooked-for way, they would meet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267'></a>267</span>
</p>
<p>
But since she had given the offence, could she
not be brave enough to put her fate to the touch
and
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Win&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;lose&nbsp;&nbsp;it&nbsp;&nbsp;all”?<br />
</p>
<p>
The words that had always seemed so hard to
say came readily enough, as she told the story of
the human blighted rose that had brought a new
faith to her.
</p>
<p>
Dil seemed to rally before the doctor came.
She opened her eyes, and glanced around with the
old bright smile.
</p>
<p>
“It’s all queer an’ strange like,” she said;
“but you’m here, an’ it’s all right. Did I faint
away? ’Cause my head feels light an’ wavery as
it did that Sunday night.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you fainted. But you are better now.
And the doctor will give you a tonic to help you
get well. We all want you to get well.”
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t never been sick, ’cept when I was in
the hospital, hurted. I only feel tired, for I
ain’t got no pain anywhere, an’ I’ll soon get
rested. ’Cause I want to go down home an’ see
<em>him</em>. If I <em>could</em> go over to the Square on Sat’day.
I ’most know he’ll be waitin’ for me.”
</p>
<p>
Should she tell the poor child? Oh, was she
sure John Travis would come? He need not see
<em>her</em>. She had not asked for herself.
</p>
<p>
The kindly, middle-aged doctor looked in upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268'></a>268</span>
them at this moment, accompanied by Miss Mary.
Dil smiled with such cheerful brightness that it
almost gave the contradiction to her pale face.
He sat down beside her, counted her pulse, talked
pleasantly until she no longer felt strange, but
answered his questions, sometimes with a shade
of diffidence when they reflected on her mother’s
cruelty, but always with a frank sort of innocence.
Then he listened to her breathing, heart
and lungs, and the spot where the two ribs were
broken, “that hadn’t ever felt quite good when
you rubbed over it,” she admitted. He held up
her hand, and seemed to study its curious transparency.
</p>
<p>
“So you are only a little tired? Well, you
have done enough to tire one out, and now you
must have a good long rest. Will you stay here
content?” he asked kindly.
</p>
<p>
“Everybody’s so good!” and her eyes shone
with a glad, grateful light. “But I’d like to go
by Sat’day. There’s somethin’—Miss Deerin’
knows”—and an expectant smile parted her lips.
</p>
<p>
“Well, to-day’s Thursday, and there’s Friday.
We’ll see about it. I’d like you to stay in bed
and be pretty quiet—not worry—”
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t got nothin’ to worry ’bout,” with her
soft little laugh. “It’s all come round right, an’
what I wanted to know most of all, I c’n know on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269'></a>269</span>
Sat’day. I kin look out o’ the winder and see
the trees ’n’ the sunshine, an’ hear the birds sing.
An’ everybody speaks so sweet an’ soft to you,
like ’s if their voices was makin’ music. O no, I
don’t mind, only the children’ll want Miss Deerin’,
and I want her too.”
</p>
<p>
“Your want is the most needful. She shall
stay with you.”
</p>
<p>
The brown quartz eyes irradiated with luminous
gleams.
</p>
<p>
“Very well,” he said, with an answering smile.
</p>
<p>
Miss Deering came out in the hall. He shut
the door carefully.
</p>
<p>
“If she wants anything or anybody, let her
have it. Keep her generally quiet, and in bed.
Though nothing can hurt her very much. It is
too late to help or hinder.”
</p>
<p>
“O surely you do not mean”—Miss Deering
turned white to the very lips.
</p>
<p>
“She’s as much worn out as a woman of eighty
ought to be. If you could look at her, through
her, with the eye of science, you would wonder
how the machinery keeps going. It is worn to
the last thread, and her poor little heart can
hardly do its work. Her cheerfulness is in her
favor. But some moment all will stop. There
will be little suffering; it <em>is</em> old age, the utter lack
of vitality. And she’s hardly a dozen years old.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270'></a>270</span>
</p>
<p>
“She is fifteen—yes, I think she is right,
though I could hardly believe it at first.”
</p>
<p>
“That poor little thing! I hope with all my
soul there is a heaven where the lost youth is
made up to these wronged little ones. She has
been doing a woman’s work on a child’s strength.”
</p>
<p>
“O can nothing save her?” cried Virginia
Deering, with longing desire. “For her life
might be so happy. She has found friends—”
</p>
<p>
“It all comes too late. If you should ever be
tempted to reason away heaven, think of her and
hundreds like her, and what else shall make
amends? I will be in again this afternoon,”
and he turned away abruptly.
</p>
<p>
He met Miss Mary in the lower hall, and left
her amazed at the intelligence. She came up-stairs
and found Virginia with her eyes full of
tears.
</p>
<p>
“And I thought last night she looked so improved.
It is so sudden, so unexpected.”
</p>
<p>
“How long?” asked Virginia, with a great
tremble in her voice.
</p>
<p>
“Any time, my dear. A day or two, an hour
may be. We must keep it from the children. So
many have improved, and no one has died. I
can’t believe it.”
</p>
<p>
“I want to stay with her,” the girl said in a
low tone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271'></a>271</span>
</p>
<p>
“We shall be so grateful to you. You young
girls are so good to give up your own pleasures,
and help us in our work.”
</p>
<p>
Virginia went back quietly. Dil’s face was
turned toward the window, and she was listening
to the children’s voices, as they ran around tumultuously.
</p>
<p>
“They do be havin’ such a good time,” she
said, with a thrill of satisfaction in her tone.
</p>
<p>
“I wish you were well enough to join them,”
Virginia replied softly.
</p>
<p>
Dil laughed. “I’ve been such a big, big girl
this long time,” she returned with a sense of
amusement, but no longing in her tone. “I don’t
seem to know ’bout playin’ as they do; for mammy
had so many babies, an’ Bess was hurted, an’ there
wasn’t never no room to play in Barker’s Court,
’count o’ washin’ an’ such. ’Pears like I’d feel
strange runnin’ an’ careerin’ round like thim,”
and she made a motion with her head. “I’d
rather lay here an’ get well. Oh, do you think
the doctor’ll let me go on Sat’day?”
</p>
<p>
“My dear, I have written to Mr. Travis. I
think he will be up then.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” Such a joyful light illumined the face,
that Virginia had much ado to keep the tears
from her own eyes. “You’re so good,” she said
softly. “Everybody’s so good.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272'></a>272</span>
</p>
<p>
“And the children don’t disturb you?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, no; I like it. I c’n jest shut my eyes ’n’
see ‘Ring around a rosy.’ Oh,” with a long, long
sigh, “Bess would ’a’ liked it so! I’m so sorry
she couldn’t come ’n’ see it all, the beautiful
flowers ’n’ trees ’n’ the soft grass you c’n tumble
on ’n’ turn summersets as they did yest’day.
Don’t you s’pose, Miss Deerin’, there’ll be a
whole heaven for the children by themselves?
For <em>he</em> told me somethin’ ’bout ’many mansions’
the Lord Jesus went to fix for thim all. Ain’t it
queer how things come to you?”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273'></a>273</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>XV—JOHN TRAVIS</h2>
<p>
She lay there quietly all the morning, little
Dilsey Quinn, trying in her hopeful fashion to
hurry and get well. It was nicer than the hospital,
and Miss Deering was so sweet, as she sat
there crocheting some lovely rose-wheels out of
pale-blue silk. Now and then some sentences
flashed between them, and a soft little laugh from
Dil. Miss Deering felt more like crying.
</p>
<p>
The doctor came about three.
</p>
<p>
“I’m most well,” said Dil, with her unabated
cheerfulness. “Only when I raise up somethin’
seems tied tight around me here,” putting her
hand to her side. “’N’ you think I c’n be well on
Sat’day, cause—some one might come—”
</p>
<p>
“Are you expecting a visitor?”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Deerin’ knows. An’ he’s one of the
sure kind. Yes; he’ll surely come. An’ if I
stay in bed all day to-day, don’t you s’pose I’ll be
well to-morrow?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll see. You and Miss Deering seem to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274'></a>274</span>
be planning secrets. I shall have to look sharp
after both of you. And who brings you flowers?”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Mary. An’ some custard, an’ oh, Miss
Deerin’ fed me like as if I was a baby.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all right. It’s high time you were
waited on a little. But I’d like you to take a nap.
Miss Deering, couldn’t you read her to sleep?”
</p>
<p>
“I will try.”
</p>
<p>
“She ought to sleep some,” studying the wide
eyes.
</p>
<p>
“But I’m not a bit sleepy. I’m thinkin’ ’bout
when <em>he</em> comes, an’ how he’ll help me find Bess.”
</p>
<p>
“It is astonishing,” the doctor said down-stairs.
“She has some wonderful vitality. It seemed
this morning as if she couldn’t last an hour, and
now if she wasn’t all worn out she might recover.
But it is the last flash of the expiring fire.
Is there some friend to come?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” answered Miss Deering with a faint
flush.
</p>
<p>
“She will live till then. If, she suffers we
must try opiates, but we will hardly need, I
think.”
</p>
<p>
“And—the excitement—”
</p>
<p>
“She will not get excited. She is strangely
tranquil. Do not disturb her serene hope, whatever
it is.”
</p>
<p>
The day drew to a close again. Dil asked if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275'></a>275</span>
she was not going to her own bed, and seemed
quite content. Miss Mary came in early in the
evening and sent Virginia to bed. She could not
quite believe the dread fiat. For Dil might be
made so happy in the years to come. Ah, God,
must it be too late? It seemed like the refinement
of cruelty.
</p>
<p>
She came back about midnight, but Miss Mary
motioned her away, and then went out in the hall.
</p>
<p>
“You must go to bed in earnest,” she said.
“You may be needed more later on. She is very
quiet; but she lies there with her eyes wide
open, as if she were seeing visions. I get a nap
now and then; you see, I’m used to this kind of
work.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish ’twas mornin’,” Dil said toward early
dawn. “I want to hear the birds sing an’ the
children playin’; they do laugh so glad an’ comfortin’.
An’ I wisht there could be some babies
tumblin’ round in the sweet grass. They’d like it
so. Don’t you <em>never</em> have any babies?”
</p>
<p>
“There are other homes for babies,” was the
reply.
</p>
<p>
“Do you s’pose it’ll ever get all round,—homes,
an’ care, an’ joy, an’ such? There’s so many,
you know. There was little girls in Barker’s
Court who had to sew, an’ never could go out, not
even Sundays. When ’twas nice, Bess an’ me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276'></a>276</span>
used to go out on Sat’days. But the winter froze
her all up. And the other poor children—”
</p>
<p>
“They will all get here by degrees.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s so good in folks to think of it.”
</p>
<p>
“My dear, you must go to sleep.”
</p>
<p>
“But I don’t feel sleepy,” and Dil’s face was
sweet with her serene smile. “There’s so many
lovely things to think about.”
</p>
<p>
“Try a little, to please me.”
</p>
<p>
Dilsey shut her eyes and lay very still. Was
there some mysterious change in the face?
</p>
<p>
And so dawned another morning. Virginia
Deering came in with a handful of flowers, which
she laid beside Dilsey’s cheek on the pillow.
</p>
<p>
“Oh,” the child began in a breathless sort of
way, “do you think he’ll be here to-morrow, Sat’day?
Cause I don’t b’l’eve I’d be well ’nuff to go
down. I don’t seem to get reel rested like. An’
you’ll have to send word to Patsey. He wanted
me to stay a good long while, an’ get fat, an’ I
want to try.”
</p>
<p>
Did <em>she</em> feel sure John Travis would come?
Ah, she would <em>not</em> doubt. She would take the
child’s sublime faith for her stay. Even if he
had ceased to care for her, he would not disappoint
the child who relied so confidently upon his
word.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I know he will come.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277'></a>277</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’ll be all right, then. An’ I’ll get up to-morrow
an’ be dressed, an’ go down-stairs all
strong an’ rested like. An’ I think he’ll know
about Bess.”
</p>
<p>
Virginia bent over and kissed her.
</p>
<p>
“Ain’t the children jealous ’cause you stay
here so much?” she asked presently. “They all
like you so. An’ they was so glad to see you.”
</p>
<p>
“They do not mind,” she made answer to the
unselfish child; “and I like to stay with you.”
</p>
<p>
“Do you? I’m glad too,” she said dreamily.
</p>
<p>
But now and then she was a little restless. The
doctor merely looked at her and smiled. But outside
he said to Miss Mary, “I doubt if she goes
through another night.”
</p>
<p>
“What shall I do for you?” Virginia asked
later on. There seemed such a wistfulness in the
eyes turned to the window.
</p>
<p>
“It’s queer like, but seems to me as if Bess was
comin’. P’raps she’s jes’ found out where I be.
O Miss Deerin’, are there any wild roses? I’d
like to have some for Bess.”
</p>
<p>
Virginia glanced up in vague alarm.
</p>
<p>
“I think if I had some Bess would come back.
’N’ I’m all hungry like to see her.”
</p>
<p>
Dil moved uneasily, and worked her fingers with
a nervous motion.
</p>
<p>
“There have been some over back of the woods
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278'></a>278</span>
there,” and Miss Mary inclined her head. “There
were in June, I remember.”
</p>
<p>
“I might go and see.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, will you? I wisht so I had some.”
</p>
<p>
“The walk will do you good.” There had come
a distraught look in Virginia’s face. Oh, what if
John Travis failed! Even to-morrow might be
too late.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll let the children go with you,” said Dil.
“They’ll like it so; an’ I’ll keep still ’n’ try to go
to sleep.”
</p>
<p>
The old serenity came back with the smile. She
had learned so many lessons of patience and self-denial
in the short life, the grand patience perfected
through love and sacrifice, the earthly type
of that greater love. But the sweet little face almost
unnerved Virginia.
</p>
<p>
The children hailed her with delight, and clung
so to her gown that she could hardly take a step.
Perhaps it was their noise that had unconsciously
worn upon Dil’s very slender nerves. Miss Mary
read to her awhile, and in the soft, soothing silence
she fell asleep.
</p>
<p>
Yes, she had come to that sign and seal indelibly
stamped on the faces of the “called.” The
dread something no word can fitly describe, and
it was so much more apparent in her sleep.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Mary,” said an attendant, “can you come
down a moment?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279'></a>279</span>
</p>
<p>
She guessed without a word when she saw a
young man standing there with a basket of wild
roses. But he could not believe the dread fiat
at first. She had been “a little ill,” and “wasn’t
strong” were the tidings that had startled him,
and she had gone to a home for the “Little
Mothers” to recruit. He had heard some other
incidents of her sad story, and he remembered
the children’s pathetic clinging to the wild roses.
Nothing could give her greater pleasure.
</p>
<p>
He walked reverently up the wide, uncarpeted
steps, beside Miss Mary. Dil was still asleep, or—O
Heaven! was she dead? Miss Mary bent
over, touched her cool cheek.
</p>
<p>
Dil opened her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been asleep. It was so lovely. I’m all
rested like—why, I’m most well.”
</p>
<p>
“Well enough to see an old friend?”
</p>
<p>
Oh, the glow in her eyes, the eager, asking expression
of every feature. She gave a soft, exultant
cry as John Travis emerged from Miss Mary’s
shadow, and stretched out her hands.
</p>
<p>
“My dear, dear little Dil!”
</p>
<p>
All the room was full of the faint, delicious
fragrance of wild roses, kept so moist and sheltered
they were hardly conscious of their journey.
And she lay trembling in two strong arms, so instinct
with vitality, that she seemed to take from
them a sudden buoyant strength.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280'></a>280</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ve been waitin’ for you so long,” she exclaimed
when she found breath to speak. There
was no reproach in the tone, rather a heavenly
satisfaction that he had come now. Her trust
had been crowned with fruition, that was enough.
</p>
<p>
“My little girl!” Oh, surely it could not be
as bad as they said. The future that he had
planned for, that he had meant to make pleasant
and satisfying, and perhaps beautiful, from the
fervent gratitude of a manly heart. Was she
beyond anything he could do for her? Oh, he
would not believe it!
</p>
<p>
“I was detained so much longer abroad than
I expected,” he began. “And we did not get in
until Monday morning. I went to Barker’s Court,
and could not learn where you were. Then I bethought
myself of the cop at the square,” smiling
as he designated the man.
</p>
<p>
“An’ he gev you my letter?”
</p>
<p>
“He gave me the letter. I hunted up the boys.
I saw Patsey and Owen last night, and they are
counting on your getting well. They sent you so
much love. And to-day I went to Chester. Here
are your roses.”
</p>
<p>
He tumbled them out all dewy from the wet
papers. Oh, such sweetness! Dil breathed it in
ecstatic delight. She had no words. She looked
her unutterable joy out of her limpid brown eyes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281'></a>281</span>
and he had much ado to keep the tears from his.
So pale, so spiritualized, yet so little like Bess,
and—oh, the last hope died as he took in all the
signs. For surely, surely she was on the road to
heaven and Bess. No hand of love, no touch of
prosperity, could hold her back.
</p>
<p>
“’Pears like everything’s come, an’ there ain’t
nothin’ left to wish for,” she said as he laid her
down again, and watched the transfigured face.
“For now you c’n tell me ’bout Bess. Mother
burned up the book one day, an’ we never could
quite know, only she got crost the river, an’ they
was all so glad at the pallis. An’ Bess was so
sure you’d come. The cough was dreadful when
we didn’t have some good medicine that helped
her. An’ the lady come one afternoon, ’n’ mammy
was home ’n’ she was norful sassy to her. You
see, we hadn’t dast to tell mammy—”
</p>
<p>
“My poor child!” He was toying with the soft,
tumbled hair. He had heard another side of the
story, and of Mrs. Quinn’s insulting impudence.
</p>
<p>
“An’ then Bess she smelt the wild roses all
around one night, an’ thought she was gettin’
better—an’—an’ she jus’ died.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; God came for her in the night. He put
his arms around her, and wrapped her in the
garment of his great love, and took her through
the pathway of the stars. She did not feel any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282'></a>282</span>
cold nor pain, and he gave her a new, glorified
body, so she could leave the poor old one behind.”
</p>
<p>
“But she wouldn’t have leaved me ’thout a
word, when she loved me so, an’ wanted me to go
to heaven with her.”
</p>
<p>
Dil’s lip quivered, and her chest heaved with
the effort of keeping back the tears.
</p>
<p>
“My dear child, there are many mysteries that
one cannot wholly explain. Don’t you remember
telling me the Mission teacher said it was an
allegory, a story that is like our daily lives? We
are going heavenward in every right and tender
and loving thing we do. We are the children of
God as well as the children of mortal parents;
God gives us the soul, the part of us that is to
live forever. And when he calls this part of you
to the heavenly mansions, he gives it the perfect
new body. The old one is laid away in the
ground. When Jesus was here he helped and
cured people as I told you. But he does not
come any more. He calls people to him, and
sends his angels for them. So he said, ‘It is
very hard for poor little Bess to wait all winter, to
suffer with the cold, the pain in her maimed body,
to be afraid of her mother, to hear the babies cry
when her head aches. She must come to the land
of pure delight, and have her new body. She
must be well and joyous and happy, so that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283'></a>283</span>
can run and greet her sister Dil when I send for
her.”
</p>
<p>
Dilsey Quinn was listening with rapt attention.
But at the last words she cried out with tremulous
eagerness,—
</p>
<p>
“Oh, will he send? Will he take me to Bess?
You are quite sure?”
</p>
<p>
Her very breath seemed to hang on the answer.
</p>
<p>
“He will send. He has a place for you in the
many mansions he went to prepare. And this
little step we take from one world to the other is
called the river of death, and you know how Christiana
went through it. Sometimes the Lord Jesus
lifts people quite over it.”
</p>
<p>
There was a long silence. He could see she
was studying the deep, puzzling points. The
lines came in her forehead, white as a lily now,
and her eyes seemed peering into fathomless
depths.
</p>
<p>
Looking into the sweet, wasted face, holding
the slim little hands, once so plump and brown,
thinking of the heroic, loving life, he felt that
indeed “of such was the kingdom of heaven.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, ’f I c’n go to Bess,” a sigh of heavenly
resignation seemed to quiver through the frail
body, “’n’ I think the Lord couldn’t help bein’
good to Bess, she was so sweet ’n’ patient; for
’twas so hard not to run about, ’n’ have to be lifted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284'></a>284</span>
’n’ I couldn’t always come on ’count of the babies
’n’ mother ’n’ things. ’N’ she never got cross.
’N’ I do b’lieve she understood ’bout Christiana,
for after that she wanted so to go to heaven. An’
she was so glad about her poor hurted legs bein’
made well. We couldn’t read fast, you know; an’
we couldn’t see into things, ’cause we hadn’t been
to school much. But she kinder picked it out, she
was such a wise little thing, an’ the pictures helped.
But I don’t understand ’bout the new body.”
</p>
<p>
Her face was one thought of puzzled intensity.
</p>
<p>
“My dear little Dil, we none of us quite understand.
It is a great mystery. The Lord Jesus
came down from heaven and was born a little
child that children might not be afraid of him,
but learn to love him. When he grew to manhood
he helped the needy, the suffering, and
healed their illnesses. He went about doing good
to everybody, and there were people who did not
believe in him and treated him cruelly.” How
could he explain the great sacrifice to her comprehension?
“Dil,” he said in a low tone, “suppose
you could have saved Bess great sorrow and suffering
by dying for her, would you not have done
it? Suppose that night the Lord Jesus had said
to you, ‘I can only take one of you to-night,
which one shall it be?’ What would you have
done?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285'></a>285</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I’d let her gone. Was it that way?”
The tears stood in her eyes, and her voice
trembled with tenderest emotion.
</p>
<p>
“God loves us all as you loved Bess. But we
do not all love him. We are not ready to do the
things he tells us, to be truthful and honest and
kindly. But he is ready to forgive us to the very
last. And he knows what is best for us.”
</p>
<p>
“Then that other body went to heaven,” she
said after a long silence. “An’ I know now she
must have been in some lovely place, ’cause that
Sunday she come to me in Cent’l Park she was all
smilin’ an’ strange an’ sweet, an’ beautiful like
that picture you made. She looked jes’ ’s if she
wanted to tell me somethin’. An’ the Lord Jesus
let her out of heaven ’cause I was so lost like ’n’
uncertain.”
</p>
<p>
The small face was illumined with joy. And
to John Travis it was as the face of an angel.
</p>
<p>
He owed her so much. Again had God chosen
the weak things of the world to confound the
mighty. He thought of that other soul whose
throes he had watched; whose guide-posts of
science and philosophy had shed no light on the
unknown hereafter; and how both of them had at
last become little children in the faith. For when
he promised to go to heaven with Bess and Dilsey
Quinn, he meant to search out the way of truth if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286'></a>286</span>
such a thing was possible. His had been a slower
and more toilsome way, but Dil had seen and believed,
and was among the blessed already. And
he had come to a realization of the higher truths,
not according to the lights of human knowledge,
but faith in the Lord Jesus.
</p>
<p>
“I shall be so glad to see Bess. I’m most
worn out an’ wasted away longin’ for her. But
when I see her all straight an’ strong an’ lovely
in heaven, I’ll feel rested right away. I d’n’
know how the Lord Jesus can care so much ’bout
poor sick folks, when there’s so many splendid
people.”
</p>
<p>
“Just as you cared for Bess.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, was that the way?” Her smile had the
radiance of the everlasting knowledge. “But
you see, I’d had Bess alwers an’ loved her, ’n’ he
didn’t know much about us, stowed away there in
Barker’s Court. So he’s better ’n any folks. He
had all that lovely heaven, an’ he didn’t need to
come down. He must have loved people uncommon.
It was like your stoppin’ that day an’
talkin’ to us poor little mites. Why, ’twas jes’ if
you’d made a new splendid world for us!”
</p>
<p>
She stopped a moment and drew some long
breaths. Then an eager light flashed across her
face.
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” she cried, “I’ve found the lady who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287'></a>287</span>
gev the wild roses to Patsey that day. She’s
here, ’n’ all the children are jes’ crazy ’bout her.
An’ she told me ’bout the picture you put me in.
She said you’d be sure to come.”
</p>
<p>
“She? Who?” John Travis was momentarily
bewildered.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Deerin’, Miss Virginia Deerin’. Ain’t
it a pretty name? An’ she knows all ’bout that
beautiful place of roses. I was hankerin’ so for
some, an’ she went out to see ’f she could find
any. I couldn’t know you’d bring me such a
lovely lot. Don’t you know how Bess alwers
b’l’eved you’d come, an’ <em>she</em> b’l’eves jes’ that way.
An’ she likes you so.”
</p>
<p>
“Virginia Deering!” John Travis said under
his breath, his whole frame athrill with subtle
emotion, “what makes you think she likes me?”
he asked softly.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, can’t you tell it in any one’s voice? An’
their eyes get soft an’ strange, ’s if they were
lookin’ ’way off, an’ saw the other one comin’,
jes’ ’s Bess come to me that day.”
</p>
<p>
Then Dil raised a little and glanced out of the
window, listened smilingly.
</p>
<p>
“She’s come back. That’s her voice. An’ oh,
won’t she be glad to see you an’ the heaps an’
heaps of wild roses!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288'></a>288</span><a name='chXVI' id='chXVI'></a>XVI—ACROSS THE RIVER</h2>
<p>
Virginia Deering put by the children’s clinging
hands. Her mission had not been very successful.
In one shady depth she had found a
cluster of belated roses, their mates having blossomed
and gone. But the children had enjoyed a
rare pleasure.
</p>
<p>
She came up with a sort of reverent hesitation.
She had been thinking of the journey “betwixt
this and dawn,” and trying with weak hands to
push it farther and farther off, as we always do.
Miss Mary had gone to the infirmary. The room
was so still; then a soft, glad cry trembled on
the air,—
</p>
<p>
“He’s come, Miss Deerin’! An’ oh, you won’t
mind, but he’s been to that wild rose place, an’ I
think he’s brought them <em>all</em> to me. Look, look!”
and she stretched out her little hands.
</p>
<p>
Virginia paused, hesitated, her sweet face flushing
and paling, as John Travis turned. He was
not sure he had made up his mind to any certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289'></a>289</span>
step; but, having found her here, he was certain
he should never let her go again in this mortal
life.
</p>
<p>
Did it make any difference here in this sacred
hour who had sinned? Could not even suffering
love fold about another the garment of forgiveness?
He took a step forward; she seemed to
draw near by some inward volition, and stretched
out her hands beseechingly. The sorrow and pain
were ended. Was not love too sacred a thing to
be bruised and wounded by trifles that should have
been forgiven and forgotten as soon as uttered?
</p>
<p>
“Virginia,” in a breathless sort of whisper. He
stooped and kissed the quivering lips, and caught
the tenderness of tear-blinded eyes.
</p>
<p>
“Little Dil, may <em>I</em> have Miss Deering’s roses?”
and he took them in his hand.
</p>
<p>
“I only found a few,” in a faltering voice.
</p>
<p>
“But he’s brought me hundreds. I’m most
buried in roses. An’, Miss Virginia, I told him
you’d be so glad. An’ it’s all as you said, only I
couldn’t feel quite sure till <em>he</em> come. The Lord
Jesus did take Bess to heaven that night; but he
left me ’cause there was somethin’ for me to do.
It’s all gettin’ plain to me, only I ain’t bright to
see into things quick. But you can’t both be
mistook. An’ now I’m all bright an’ happy.”
</p>
<p>
Did Virginia Deering say a year ago that she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290'></a>290</span>
should always hate wild roses? She buried her
face in them now, so that no one should see her
tears. God had led this little human wild rose in
the pathway of both. It had grown in the world’s
wilderness, and learned how to bloom out of its
own generous heart. To her it was the lesson of
her whole life.
</p>
<p>
Dilsey Quinn smiled. She knew nothing about
love and lovers; but the atmosphere was sweet
and cordial, and she felt that.
</p>
<p>
Virginia began to arrange some of the roses in
a bowl, with the nervous desire of occupation.
</p>
<p>
“Please put thim here on the sill,” pleaded
Dilsey. “That’s the way Bess had thim. An’ I
told him how you gev thim to Patsey.”
</p>
<p>
John Travis gave a soft, quaint smile, and took
a small case from an inside pocket. There were
some poor little withered buds between the
leaves. All the color had gone out of them, all
the fragrance.
</p>
<p>
“You gave them to me,” he said. “Do you remember?
Bess had them in her hand.”
</p>
<p>
Dilsey’s eyes filled with tears. Virginia leaned
over and looked at them, strangely moved. Then
he laid the few she had gathered beside them.
</p>
<p>
“I’m jes’ happy all through,” Dil said with
shining eyes.
</p>
<p>
Miss Mary came up with some broth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291'></a>291</span>
</p>
<p>
“’Pears like I don’t never want anythin’ to eat
again; but you’re all so good. An’ now I’m goin’
to get well, though sometimes I want to see Bess
so. An’ I’d be sorry to go ’way from Patsey.
Owen’s gettin’ to be such a nice boy. Patsey
keeps him straight. I d’know who’d look after
thim.”
</p>
<p>
John Travis turned and gave her a rare, comforting
smile. He owed her so much earthly and
heavenly happiness; and he realized with a pang
of anguish that she could never be repaid in this
world. Had God noted the labor and love of this
poor, unknown life, and written it in his Book,—the
heroism so simply worked out, with no
thought of self to mar any of it?
</p>
<p>
Miss Mary sent them down to supper.
</p>
<p>
“I am so thankful you had my letter in time,”
Virginia said softly. “We did not think then—”
</p>
<p>
She turned scarlet under his gaze.
</p>
<p>
“Your letter! Oh, <em>did</em> you write? My darling,
thank you! You shame me with your trust, your
sweet readiness to forgive. But I have hardly
been at home these two days. I think,” and his
voice fell to a reverent inflection, “that God was
watching over it all, and guiding our steps. It is
a long story, and some day you shall hear it all,
but in infinite pathos Dilsey Quinn’s far exceeds
it. Our whole lives will be more sacred to us for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292'></a>292</span>
this remembrance. But I cannot bear to have
her go. Is it as the nurse said?”
</p>
<p>
Virginia made a sign with her bowed head.
</p>
<p>
“I hoped so to give her a better, brighter life.
I left a little work for her in the hands of a
friend, and it came to naught. But perhaps—God’s
love <em>must</em> be wiser than our human plans,
and his love is greater. We must rest content
with that. But she has been an evangel to
me.”
</p>
<p>
Miss Mary bathed the face and hands of her
invalid in some fragrant water. She had considered
Dil a rather dull and uninteresting child
at first; but her pitiful story that had come to
light in fragments, her passionate love for her
little “hurted” sister, and her wild dream of
going to heaven, had moved them all immeasurably.
The cheerful sweetness would have deceived
any but practised eyes, and even now Dil
seemed buoyed up by her delicious happiness.
</p>
<p>
“Won’t they come back?” she asked presently,
with a touch of longing in her voice.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, dear.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like him to stay.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, he shall stay.”
</p>
<p>
The household had not been disturbed by the
near approach of the awesome visitant. The
children had not missed her, since she had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293'></a>293</span>
brought no gayety to them, but rather grudged
Miss Virginia to her. They were at their supper
now. How easily they had forgotten the hardships
of their lives!
</p>
<p>
Virginia and John Travis entered presently.
The soft summer night fell about them, as they
sat watching the frail little body, so wasted that
its vitality was fast ebbing. She talked in quaint,
disjointed snatches, piecing the year’s story together
with a pathos almost heart-breaking in its
very simplicity. Her trust in him had been so
perfect.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what’s ’come o’ mother,” she
said, after one of the silences. “But Bess ’n’
me’ll tell the Lord Jesus ’bout her, ’n’ mebbe he
can do somethin’ that’ll keep her ’way from Mrs.
MacBride’s, ’cause she wasn’t so bad before she
took to goin’ there. I’ve been so feared of her
all the time, but I don’t feel feared no more.
Bess said we shouldn’t when you came back, and
wisht your name had been Mr. Greatheart. We
liked him so. But they’ve all gone wrong in
Barker’s Court. Oh, can’t some one set thim
right an’ straight, an’ bring thim outen the trouble
an’ drinkin’ an’ beatin’, an’ show thim the way?
It’s jes’ like thim folks leavin’ the City of Destruction.
An’ oh, we’ve all come out of it, Owny
an’ little Dan. Maybe mother’ll find the way.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294'></a>294</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll find her and try to show her,” said John
Travis, with a voice full of emotion.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, will you?” There was a satisfying delight
in her tone. “An’ the boys? If some
one’d look after thim, I think I’d like to go to
Bess. Do you b’l’eve the Lord Jesus would come
an’ take me if I ast him? Seems so long since I
had Bess.”
</p>
<p>
“I think he will,” Travis said, in a tone he
tried to keep steady.
</p>
<p>
“I ain’t pritty, like Bess, an’ I can’t sing.”
</p>
<p>
“But you will sing there. And you will love
the Saviour. That is all he asks.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t seem to understand how he could be
so good to poor folks. An’ I don’t see why they
ain’t all jes’ wild to love Him. Tell me some
more ’bout his comin’ down from heaven to help
thim.”
</p>
<p>
With the little hand in his, he told the wider,
greater story of the Saviour’s love,—how he had
come to redeem, to sanctify all future suffering in
his own, to give himself a ransom. And even
now Travis’s mind reverted to the hours of discussion
with his cousin. Ah, how could he have
brought bread to that famishing soul, that had fed
so long on the husks of the world’s wisdom, but
for the afternoon with the children, the meeting
with the Lord Jesus in the way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295'></a>295</span>
</p>
<p>
The moon came up and flooded the room with
softened splendor, the summer night was fragrant
with exquisite odors. Almost it seemed as if the
very heavens were opened. The wide eyes were
full of wordless rapture, and a great content
shone in the ethereal face.
</p>
<p>
Then Dilsey moved about restlessly.
</p>
<p>
“My little Dil, what can I do for you?” he
asked with tender solicitude.
</p>
<p>
A strange shudder seemed to run over her.
Was it a premonition?
</p>
<p>
“I wish you’d take me in your strong arms ’n’
hold me. ’Pears if I’d like to be clost to some
one, just sheltered like. An’ you an’ Miss Virginia
sing ’bout ‘The rivers of delight.’”
</p>
<p>
John Travis lifted her up. She was so small
and light; a child who was never to know any
earthly joy or hope of girlhood, who would learn
all the blessedness of life in the world to come.
Virginia folded the soft blanket about her, and
her face rested against the shoulder that would
have been glad to bear a far heavier burthen for
her. He took the cool little hands in his, and
noted the fluttering, feeble pulse, the faint, irregular
beating of the tired heart against his.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes both voices came to a pause through
emotion. He remembered the other scene in the
stuffy little room, and could see Bess’s enraptured
face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296'></a>296</span>
</p>
<p>
Then Dilsey Quinn gave a little start, and
raised her head, turning her eyes to him.
</p>
<p>
“I c’n understand it all now,” she said joyously.
“The Lord Jesus wanted me to wait till
you come back, so I could tell Bess. An’, Miss
Virginia, she’ll be so glad to know who gave the
wild roses to Patsey. An’ you promised her—you’d
come. We was all goin’ to heaven—together—”
</p>
<p>
The head dropped. The heart was still. The
labor of the hands was done. The slow brain
had the wisdom of the stars. But her eyes still
kept the subtle glory; a radiance not of this
world shone in her face as she left the night
behind her and stepped into the dawn of everlasting
life.
</p>
<p>
“She has seen Bess.”
</p>
<p>
Then John Travis laid her reverently on the cot,
and sprinkled a baptism of roses over her. The
two left behind, clasped hands, their whole lives
sanctified by the brave sweetness and devotion of
this one gone up to God.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
No one told the “little mothers” that one of
their number lay up-stairs in Miss Mary’s room
waxen white and still in her last sleep. They
sang and played and ran and shouted, perhaps
jangled as well. Death often met them in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297'></a>297</span>
byways of the slums, but in this land of enchantment
they were not looking for it. Their holidays
were brief enough; their days of toil and deprivation
stretched out interminably. How could they
sorrow for this pale, quiet little girl who had not
even played with them?
</p>
<p>
In the afternoon John Travis brought up Patsey
and Owen, who were stunned by the unlooked-for
tidings. Dil had on her white frock, Patsey’s
gift, that had been both pride and pleasure to
him.
</p>
<p>
Owen looked at her steadily and in great awe,
winking hard to keep back the tears. Patsey
wiped his away with his coat-sleeve.
</p>
<p>
“Ther’ wasn’t ever no girl like Dil Quinn,” he
said brokenly. “She was good as gold through
and through. Nobody never loved any one as
she loved Bess. Seems like she couldn’t live
a’thout her. O mister, do you think ther’s railly
a heaven as they preach ’bout? Fer if ther’ is,
Dilly Quinn an’ Bess are angels, sure as sure. An’
Owen, we’ve got to be tip top, jes’ ’s if she was
watchin’ us all the time. But it’s norful to think
she can’t never come down home to us.”
</p>
<p>
He leaned over and kissed the thin hands, and
then sobbed aloud. But all his life long the
tender remembrance followed him.
</p>
<p>
In a corner of the pretty burying-ground where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298'></a>298</span>
they laid her, there is a simple marble shaft, with
this quaint, old-fashioned inscription:—
</p>
<div class='center'>
<p>“<span class='sc'>Sacred to the Memory of</span></p>
<p>BESS AND DILSEY QUINN.”</p>
</div>
<p>
For, even if Bess is elsewhere in an unknown
grave, her unfailing and sweetest remembrance is
here with Dilsey.
</p>
<p>
And in one home in the city, made beautiful
by love and earnest endeavor, and a wide, kindly
charity that never wearies in the Master’s work
for the poor, the sinful, and the unthankful, there
hangs a picture that Patsey Muldoon adores. It
is Dilsey Quinn idealized, as happiness and health
might have made her. The sunrise gleam in her
eyes stirs one with indescribable emotion. She
looks out so bravely sweet, so touched and informed
by the most sacred of all knowledges.
The high courage is illumined by the love that
considered not itself; the tenderness seems to say,
“to the uttermost,” through pain and toil and
discouragements; never quenched in the darkest
of times, but, even when blown about by adverse
winds, still lighting some soul. The face seems
ripened to bloom and fragrance, and speaks of a
heavenly ministry begun when the earthly was
laid down.
</p>
<p>
And the old story comes true oftener than we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299'></a>299</span>
think. Two put in the garden to keep and dress
it, to watch over the little wild roses of adverse
circumstances, crowded out of even the space and
the sun needed to grow rightfully, out of the
freshness and dew of happiness, yet making their
way up from noisome environments, and struggling
for the light and human care to fit them for the
Garden of the Lord.
</p>
<p>
And these two, who go on their way in reunited
love, understand the mystery of Dilsey Quinn’s
short life, and that the strange fine threads that
connect us here are so many chords of the greater
harmony of human love in its redemption. All
their days will be hallowed by its tender remembrance,
their work more fervent, their faith more
enduring.
</p>
<p>
And thus it came to pass that the little bruised
flowers of the slums lived not in vain.
</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

1.E.9.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
